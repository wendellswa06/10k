10k/wav/1001.wav|EN-US|EN| Focus and must check the plane.
10k/wav/1036.wav|EN-US|EN| Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
10k/wav/1046.wav|EN-US|EN| A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
10k/wav/1073.wav|EN-US|EN| We enjoyed it today.
10k/wav/1077.wav|EN-US|EN| McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
10k/wav/1080.wav|EN-US|EN| Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
10k/wav/1081.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to make an official complaint.
10k/wav/1085.wav|EN-US|EN| Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
10k/wav/1114.wav|EN-US|EN| The Hips Manager is no fuel.
10k/wav/1118.wav|EN-US|EN| It was to get even better for Motherwell.
10k/wav/1121.wav|EN-US|EN| We've always had three options and none of them perfect.
10k/wav/1126.wav|EN-US|EN| It all changes for her.
10k/wav/113.wav|EN-US|EN| They will be seen for years to come.
10k/wav/1133.wav|EN-US|EN| So, it took me back to boarding school.
10k/wav/1139.wav|EN-US|EN| The government has to grasp the nettle.
10k/wav/1150.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been a massive success.
10k/wav/1154.wav|EN-US|EN| The R7 was very difficult, but it was untrable.
10k/wav/1178.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.
10k/wav/1194.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a potential factor.
10k/wav/1196.wav|EN-US|EN| Planning is a case show.
10k/wav/1197.wav|EN-US|EN| On the other hand the poster did not help.
10k/wav/1217.wav|EN-US|EN| It seemed so personal.
10k/wav/1222.wav|EN-US|EN| They worked on it for three hours.
10k/wav/1243.wav|EN-US|EN| But that is about to change.
10k/wav/1269.wav|EN-US|EN| Now that business is banned.
10k/wav/1287.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like a basketball.
10k/wav/1294.wav|EN-US|EN| That admission is not surprising.
10k/wav/1295.wav|EN-US|EN| They never looked like winning it either.
10k/wav/1302.wav|EN-US|EN| The roll was perfect for Russell.
10k/wav/1305.wav|EN-US|EN| So now you know.
10k/wav/1317.wav|EN-US|EN| The report will be issued by March.
10k/wav/1329.wav|EN-US|EN| Colin Cameron was excellent.
10k/wav/1332.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody did in those days.
10k/wav/1334.wav|EN-US|EN| People come from all around the world to see it.
10k/wav/1337.wav|EN-US|EN| I was the last man to touch the ball.
10k/wav/1344.wav|EN-US|EN| They said there was nothing.
10k/wav/1372.wav|EN-US|EN| Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
10k/wav/1385.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to begin a programme in the ACK.
10k/wav/14.wav|EN-US|EN| At the moment, Michael is in class of his own.
10k/wav/140.wav|EN-US|EN| We would hope to make progress on that next year.
10k/wav/141.wav|EN-US|EN| If you are going to do it, do it right.
10k/wav/1413.wav|EN-US|EN| Was all this really just five months ago?
10k/wav/1415.wav|EN-US|EN| Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
10k/wav/1422.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
10k/wav/143.wav|EN-US|EN| Teams are always interesting to watch.
10k/wav/1454.wav|EN-US|EN| They are completely different from each other.
10k/wav/1456.wav|EN-US|EN| What would you ask?
10k/wav/1462.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to think.
10k/wav/1465.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the important thing.
10k/wav/1483.wav|EN-US|EN| He admitted the Siome system was not working.
10k/wav/1486.wav|EN-US|EN| Wait snot really for us if you like.
10k/wav/1495.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a good day for Scottish filming.
10k/wav/1496.wav|EN-US|EN| That will do for me.
10k/wav/15.wav|EN-US|EN| This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
10k/wav/1502.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no margin for her.
10k/wav/1509.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Campbell received a phone call.
10k/wav/1518.wav|EN-US|EN| My plates have no idea about football.
10k/wav/1526.wav|EN-US|EN| He plans to call for an aid package from Mr McDonald.
10k/wav/1529.wav|EN-US|EN| I would not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
10k/wav/1532.wav|EN-US|EN| Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
10k/wav/1566.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
10k/wav/1572.wav|EN-US|EN| This will impact on us.
10k/wav/1578.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be a challenging film.
10k/wav/1589.wav|EN-US|EN| Almost everyone had some input.
10k/wav/1606.wav|EN-US|EN| He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
10k/wav/1627.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope you missed the cut.
10k/wav/1633.wav|EN-US|EN| Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
10k/wav/1635.wav|EN-US|EN| It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
10k/wav/1637.wav|EN-US|EN| We tried everything, but it just wasunted to be today.
10k/wav/1641.wav|EN-US|EN| They would not tell us.
10k/wav/1656.wav|EN-US|EN| The door is still open but we need a bit of help.
10k/wav/1663.wav|EN-US|EN| What's happened in that game?
10k/wav/1669.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still waiting.
10k/wav/1681.wav|EN-US|EN| Kingfisher can afford to wait.
10k/wav/1687.wav|EN-US|EN| I just need a bit of luck.
10k/wav/1708.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't intend to do so now.
10k/wav/1713.wav|EN-US|EN| No injuries were reported.
10k/wav/1716.wav|EN-US|EN| It really was a masterful innings.
10k/wav/1727.wav|EN-US|EN| England could only play the other team on the park.
10k/wav/1740.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not the first to be affected.
10k/wav/1765.wav|EN-US|EN| We won very easily.
10k/wav/1786.wav|EN-US|EN| And what do we have?
10k/wav/179.wav|EN-US|EN| They said they were Neoman.
10k/wav/1795.wav|EN-US|EN| It is sayouts of character.
10k/wav/1812.wav|EN-US|EN| We shall not tea that.
10k/wav/1814.wav|EN-US|EN| Their expressions only reflected this of the audience.
10k/wav/1826.wav|EN-US|EN| Enquiries are still in an early stage
10k/wav/1830.wav|EN-US|EN| sub not used with key
10k/wav/1845.wav|EN-US|EN| I really hope he comes back.
10k/wav/185.wav|EN-US|EN| Iman has since been charged with his murder.
10k/wav/1852.wav|EN-US|EN| It was still there but right at the end.
10k/wav/1874.wav|EN-US|EN| Thou three other children had died as infants.
10k/wav/1876.wav|EN-US|EN| My father had been in love for many years.
10k/wav/191.wav|EN-US|EN| But did you shop the precedent?
10k/wav/1923.wav|EN-US|EN| The feeling is marvelous.
10k/wav/1931.wav|EN-US|EN| Why does it work?
10k/wav/1965.wav|EN-US|EN| That's in our view is an important decision.
10k/wav/1968.wav|EN-US|EN| The Hague is too good for him.
10k/wav/1979.wav|EN-US|EN| He said legal action could be considered.
10k/wav/199.wav|EN-US|EN| That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
10k/wav/1991.wav|EN-US|EN| It won the match.
10k/wav/2002.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be a miracle.
10k/wav/2009.wav|EN-US|EN| That idea is rubbish.
10k/wav/2017.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time for confession.
10k/wav/2029.wav|EN-US|EN| These findings will be made public.
10k/wav/2036.wav|EN-US|EN| After night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
10k/wav/2037.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
10k/wav/2039.wav|EN-US|EN| The film is on a tie drip.
10k/wav/2052.wav|EN-US|EN| Part of the complex is historic.
10k/wav/2061.wav|EN-US|EN| Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
10k/wav/2066.wav|EN-US|EN| The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
10k/wav/2067.wav|EN-US|EN| Something has got to, Kate.
10k/wav/2070.wav|EN-US|EN| It looks like paradise.
10k/wav/2093.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be there for us.
10k/wav/2105.wav|EN-US|EN| It will need work with changes in lifestyle.
10k/wav/2108.wav|EN-US|EN| That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
10k/wav/211.wav|EN-US|EN| The lobby is not failing.
10k/wav/2117.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an important part of the course.
10k/wav/2124.wav|EN-US|EN| Central to that cause was Barry Nicholson.
10k/wav/2134.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not true.
10k/wav/2142.wav|EN-US|EN| It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
10k/wav/2148.wav|EN-US|EN| He is quite wrong, he said.
10k/wav/2149.wav|EN-US|EN| Catch used to it.
10k/wav/2162.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be done in stages.
10k/wav/217.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all about the story.
10k/wav/2173.wav|EN-US|EN| It's so hard to shift.
10k/wav/2197.wav|EN-US|EN| The procedures were not in place.
10k/wav/2203.wav|EN-US|EN| If only the problems concern the players.
10k/wav/2218.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
10k/wav/223.wav|EN-US|EN| which are not enough.
10k/wav/2232.wav|EN-US|EN| The support from the general public was astounding.
10k/wav/2234.wav|EN-US|EN| I have good memories of Glasgow.
10k/wav/2245.wav|EN-US|EN| It was too close to call.
10k/wav/2247.wav|EN-US|EN| Only one person can claim the credit.
10k/wav/2255.wav|EN-US|EN| He is also keen to win the European order of moat.
10k/wav/2271.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not easy to live in Russia.
10k/wav/2284.wav|EN-US|EN| We can take the city.
10k/wav/2285.wav|EN-US|EN| They haven't been thought through.
10k/wav/2298.wav|EN-US|EN| Did our cauldron run on it?
10k/wav/230.wav|EN-US|EN| Also, he was floored.
10k/wav/2312.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
10k/wav/2316.wav|EN-US|EN| World leaders express their sympathy.
10k/wav/2327.wav|EN-US|EN| There's still time for that.
10k/wav/2343.wav|EN-US|EN| I carried on with him.
10k/wav/2349.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's got to be worth it.
10k/wav/2358.wav|EN-US|EN| Emotions were complex.
10k/wav/2366.wav|EN-US|EN| The money all appears to be gone.
10k/wav/2374.wav|EN-US|EN| You have asked for action.
10k/wav/2389.wav|EN-US|EN| He admitted there were two aspects of her.
10k/wav/2405.wav|EN-US|EN| Plans were made to expand.
10k/wav/2423.wav|EN-US|EN| It was tough to contain the excitement.
10k/wav/244.wav|EN-US|EN| Fast, the programme was imbalanced.
10k/wav/2454.wav|EN-US|EN| My house was shaking at the time.
10k/wav/2455.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe he will act again.
10k/wav/2459.wav|EN-US|EN| Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
10k/wav/2462.wav|EN-US|EN| Domestic disturbance is currently on general release.
10k/wav/2468.wav|EN-US|EN| It is like a bathement.
10k/wav/2470.wav|EN-US|EN| We can't go on like this.
10k/wav/2491.wav|EN-US|EN| It was like the old days.
10k/wav/2501.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never been in anything like that.
10k/wav/2502.wav|EN-US|EN| One more saloon!
10k/wav/2519.wav|EN-US|EN| He was in a mate.
10k/wav/2528.wav|EN-US|EN| Her consents were not without foundation.
10k/wav/2531.wav|EN-US|EN| My brother's buried under there.
10k/wav/2532.wav|EN-US|EN| I played well in my time there.
10k/wav/2533.wav|EN-US|EN| There is great interest on Ireland
10k/wav/2547.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a gold medal for setting.
10k/wav/2549.wav|EN-US|EN| It was so sad.
10k/wav/2560.wav|EN-US|EN| You are the glory.
10k/wav/2563.wav|EN-US|EN| It has no place in football.
10k/wav/2571.wav|EN-US|EN| It happened again yesterday.
10k/wav/258.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's get it on
10k/wav/2585.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to be now.
10k/wav/2600.wav|EN-US|EN| Despite that, it was a great day for me.
10k/wav/2607.wav|EN-US|EN| Eden's share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
10k/wav/2608.wav|EN-US|EN| John Prescott is John Prescott, as the Prime Minister would say.
10k/wav/2654.wav|EN-US|EN| I was only one auctioning differently.
10k/wav/267.wav|EN-US|EN| It is like a river running by moham
10k/wav/2678.wav|EN-US|EN| But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
10k/wav/2681.wav|EN-US|EN| The classes are taking place.
10k/wav/2690.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a thing of beauty to watch.
10k/wav/27.wav|EN-US|EN| This time he will be more on the defensive.
10k/wav/2711.wav|EN-US|EN| I got on very well with Alan.
10k/wav/2735.wav|EN-US|EN| Nicaccia waters were reported.
10k/wav/2740.wav|EN-US|EN| sub is not used with colic
10k/wav/2748.wav|EN-US|EN| My first concern is for the safety of the public.
10k/wav/2761.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be a massive boost for them.
10k/wav/2768.wav|EN-US|EN| He may need it.
10k/wav/278.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the way it is.
10k/wav/280.wav|EN-US|EN| Scott's police have been asked to join the search to find him.
10k/wav/2803.wav|EN-US|EN| The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
10k/wav/2821.wav|EN-US|EN| He said because people had invited him.
10k/wav/2828.wav|EN-US|EN| I have not seen the term immediate.
10k/wav/2841.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a budget for jobs for Scotland.
10k/wav/2847.wav|EN-US|EN| The same goes for McKinney.
10k/wav/2868.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think it is.
10k/wav/2877.wav|EN-US|EN| So it should be.
10k/wav/288.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
10k/wav/2887.wav|EN-US|EN| The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
10k/wav/2895.wav|EN-US|EN| There was an element of frustration.
10k/wav/2897.wav|EN-US|EN| The training will take place in Denny Street.
10k/wav/2903.wav|EN-US|EN| But this relative success has not been easy.
10k/wav/2905.wav|EN-US|EN| Isocentres were also affected.
10k/wav/2910.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a memorial.
10k/wav/2930.wav|EN-US|EN| A queer as a doctor is on hold.
10k/wav/2943.wav|EN-US|EN| He had returned to die.
10k/wav/2944.wav|EN-US|EN| Murray Archer is almost too clever.
10k/wav/2956.wav|EN-US|EN| Is there a new way forward?
10k/wav/2957.wav|EN-US|EN| List 2 could prove it could risk your business.
10k/wav/2971.wav|EN-US|EN| The spokeswoman set the flat in London was very small.
10k/wav/2974.wav|EN-US|EN| The port would report to the Scottish Parliament.
10k/wav/298.wav|EN-US|EN| They do not deliver.
10k/wav/2981.wav|EN-US|EN| If you don't force it, you bring it into disrepute.
10k/wav/2985.wav|EN-US|EN| It is believed that he had been stopped.
10k/wav/2992.wav|EN-US|EN| The biggest resource is our stuff.
10k/wav/301.wav|EN-US|EN| The bottom line is that this must stop.
10k/wav/3023.wav|EN-US|EN| The thumb was working.
10k/wav/3026.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a question for the next manager.
10k/wav/3027.wav|EN-US|EN| As to rugby, well, no one knows.
10k/wav/3038.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just for me.
10k/wav/3041.wav|EN-US|EN| I would like to make an impact, of course.
10k/wav/3048.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the key shoes, isn't it?
10k/wav/3050.wav|EN-US|EN| It was really surprising.
10k/wav/3067.wav|EN-US|EN| Next time and it will be different.
10k/wav/3092.wav|EN-US|EN| This man could be anywhere in the world.
10k/wav/3096.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a retailer by nature.
10k/wav/3124.wav|EN-US|EN| We stopped at half the time.
10k/wav/3129.wav|EN-US|EN| I would like Glasgow.
10k/wav/3130.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not illegal.
10k/wav/3145.wav|EN-US|EN| This wanted
10k/wav/3151.wav|EN-US|EN| We've always had a very positive attitude.
10k/wav/3162.wav|EN-US|EN| I expect a rapid response.
10k/wav/3172.wav|EN-US|EN| If I vote, and I will tell.
10k/wav/3183.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope the voters will respond.
10k/wav/319.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to be happy with the British and European record.
10k/wav/3190.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the end of an hour.
10k/wav/3198.wav|EN-US|EN| He's not very big either.
10k/wav/3199.wav|EN-US|EN| All the dead were believed to have been French.
10k/wav/3203.wav|EN-US|EN| It is difficult for Ali.
10k/wav/3216.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw one body.
10k/wav/322.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe that so, Starley.
10k/wav/3220.wav|EN-US|EN| I came into this world with nothing.
10k/wav/3223.wav|EN-US|EN| Pinedon was not mentioned.
10k/wav/3227.wav|EN-US|EN| His words were not audible.
10k/wav/323.wav|EN-US|EN| He's a nice guy.
10k/wav/324.wav|EN-US|EN| In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
10k/wav/3245.wav|EN-US|EN| The protest will go ahead as planned.
10k/wav/3250.wav|EN-US|EN| It shouldn't be a problem.
10k/wav/3258.wav|EN-US|EN| The Alliance said it may not wait.
10k/wav/3271.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a standing army.
10k/wav/3277.wav|EN-US|EN| It makes no sense.
10k/wav/3279.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything happens so quickly.
10k/wav/3301.wav|EN-US|EN| I had a boat today.
10k/wav/331.wav|EN-US|EN| And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
10k/wav/3321.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is it the European approach?
10k/wav/3336.wav|EN-US|EN| She does not want to speak.
10k/wav/3344.wav|EN-US|EN| Others may have but I am a fighter.
10k/wav/3367.wav|EN-US|EN| I've done a lot in that building.
10k/wav/3368.wav|EN-US|EN| I commit to believe she is dead.
10k/wav/3370.wav|EN-US|EN| It's soul change in Killmonic.
10k/wav/3378.wav|EN-US|EN| Sometimes they come off.
10k/wav/3384.wav|EN-US|EN| At the moment it is very difficult to know.
10k/wav/3388.wav|EN-US|EN| It can happen to you. It can happen to anyone.
10k/wav/3397.wav|EN-US|EN| Others may be trying to catch up.
10k/wav/340.wav|EN-US|EN| There's no doubt about it.
10k/wav/3404.wav|EN-US|EN| He showed he has some things to learn.
10k/wav/3411.wav|EN-US|EN| If people are genuine, then the problem is not that some have been laden.
10k/wav/3427.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a good move for me.
10k/wav/3443.wav|EN-US|EN| I really have to go now.
10k/wav/3462.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a deceit.
10k/wav/3469.wav|EN-US|EN| Centrion. Little has changed.
10k/wav/3476.wav|EN-US|EN| Consumers have generally accepted this process to date.
10k/wav/3482.wav|EN-US|EN| He's not getting any goodwill.
10k/wav/3487.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been handled entirely properly.
10k/wav/349.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that right?
10k/wav/3490.wav|EN-US|EN| Drugs are always an issue.
10k/wav/3502.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a cause for concern.
10k/wav/3505.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very frightened and dutty
10k/wav/3516.wav|EN-US|EN| She did that for the rest of her life.
10k/wav/3521.wav|EN-US|EN| Lots of them haven't recovered enough fur.
10k/wav/3522.wav|EN-US|EN| You ready to write?
10k/wav/3536.wav|EN-US|EN| What happens next?
10k/wav/3540.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the only thing I will say.
10k/wav/3557.wav|EN-US|EN| The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the Foreign Office Minister.
10k/wav/3568.wav|EN-US|EN| It was never a free kick.
10k/wav/3574.wav|EN-US|EN| We do not at the moment have a shortage.
10k/wav/3577.wav|EN-US|EN| They did a very good job.
10k/wav/359.wav|EN-US|EN| The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
10k/wav/3597.wav|EN-US|EN| A job is a job after all.
10k/wav/3630.wav|EN-US|EN| However, you could have predicted this result.
10k/wav/3638.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no doubt about that.
10k/wav/3640.wav|EN-US|EN| The police have to act to help them.
10k/wav/3659.wav|EN-US|EN| Hey, is there a lot of plot?
10k/wav/3663.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it is not all bad news for women.
10k/wav/3698.wav|EN-US|EN| This is new money.
10k/wav/370.wav|EN-US|EN| Could you put it in writing?
10k/wav/3705.wav|EN-US|EN| It is my decision and my decision alone.
10k/wav/3706.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a good result.
10k/wav/3708.wav|EN-US|EN| He was chowed for air.
10k/wav/3710.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, what can you do?
10k/wav/3734.wav|EN-US|EN| I fell in love with the ballet.
10k/wav/3737.wav|EN-US|EN| I will gut and be aggressive.
10k/wav/3742.wav|EN-US|EN| Buildings are about people.
10k/wav/3760.wav|EN-US|EN| He had no money left to run the club.
10k/wav/3806.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a great support around the route.
10k/wav/3818.wav|EN-US|EN| The line up is a tasty one.
10k/wav/3819.wav|EN-US|EN| They would be wise to do just that.
10k/wav/3828.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he intended to push for judicial review.
10k/wav/3840.wav|EN-US|EN| I can feel the sound inside
10k/wav/3841.wav|EN-US|EN| The then secretary was not amazed.
10k/wav/3842.wav|EN-US|EN| That is when we are really effective.
10k/wav/385.wav|EN-US|EN| He was not a big name.
10k/wav/3853.wav|EN-US|EN| Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
10k/wav/3868.wav|EN-US|EN| The trouble is though that there is no simple solution.
10k/wav/3882.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no doubt its rumour for us.
10k/wav/3886.wav|EN-US|EN| Heat tea is keen to redress the balance
10k/wav/3890.wav|EN-US|EN| He seemed to lose his focus.
10k/wav/3903.wav|EN-US|EN| It was clear on Thursday.
10k/wav/3904.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems ashamed to leave it.
10k/wav/3909.wav|EN-US|EN| We are keen to have him back.
10k/wav/391.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a problem we have to tackle.
10k/wav/3915.wav|EN-US|EN| But some I spent
10k/wav/3918.wav|EN-US|EN| In that case we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
10k/wav/3919.wav|EN-US|EN| We are making progress on meeting this.
10k/wav/3920.wav|EN-US|EN| If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
10k/wav/3921.wav|EN-US|EN| The home team also had their moments.
10k/wav/3932.wav|EN-US|EN| Have we not had the rainy season already?
10k/wav/3957.wav|EN-US|EN| Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
10k/wav/3963.wav|EN-US|EN| The number never came.
10k/wav/3990.wav|EN-US|EN| Another former manager, Poppy Robson said.
10k/wav/4009.wav|EN-US|EN| That end is enduring life as far as David is concerned.
10k/wav/4030.wav|EN-US|EN| The criteria have changed.
10k/wav/4033.wav|EN-US|EN| The result could be all done to turn out.
10k/wav/4066.wav|EN-US|EN| You were made to feel so welcome.
10k/wav/408.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe in having difficult times.
10k/wav/4101.wav|EN-US|EN| Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
10k/wav/4104.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no more money.
10k/wav/4106.wav|EN-US|EN| They were looking for things.
10k/wav/4107.wav|EN-US|EN| This represents a tough game for us.
10k/wav/4110.wav|EN-US|EN| They seduce it on the cat book.
10k/wav/4113.wav|EN-US|EN| We've seen that time on term again.
10k/wav/4118.wav|EN-US|EN| I just went a bit too far.
10k/wav/414.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two interests in this woodland.
10k/wav/4146.wav|EN-US|EN| It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
10k/wav/4147.wav|EN-US|EN| He put some colour into Scottish history.
10k/wav/4157.wav|EN-US|EN| The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
10k/wav/4165.wav|EN-US|EN| It was highly successful.
10k/wav/4167.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not just some male agenda.
10k/wav/4170.wav|EN-US|EN| The defender should have won the bloody par.
10k/wav/4182.wav|EN-US|EN| I can understand that.
10k/wav/419.wav|EN-US|EN| Creative expressive football was the order of the day.
10k/wav/4197.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a lovely experience.
10k/wav/4207.wav|EN-US|EN| Are they free?
10k/wav/4210.wav|EN-US|EN| This has not and has been neglected.
10k/wav/4212.wav|EN-US|EN| He was choked for four years.
10k/wav/4224.wav|EN-US|EN| The master was by then just too old.
10k/wav/4226.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all credit to them today.
10k/wav/4242.wav|EN-US|EN| They are there to get people into work.
10k/wav/4266.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going to listen to Britain.
10k/wav/4276.wav|EN-US|EN| It's only tackling congestion.
10k/wav/4284.wav|EN-US|EN| The people have been really friendly.
10k/wav/4303.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone could say it apart from Kevin Keegan.
10k/wav/4333.wav|EN-US|EN| We live on an island.
10k/wav/4340.wav|EN-US|EN| It means they actually control the program.
10k/wav/4354.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm so looking forward to it
10k/wav/4356.wav|EN-US|EN| You cannot do that in a lobby.
10k/wav/4360.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a scheme but has a lot of potential.
10k/wav/4369.wav|EN-US|EN| The fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
10k/wav/4370.wav|EN-US|EN| It means we have to have some patience.
10k/wav/438.wav|EN-US|EN| Actors turn still in the frame.
10k/wav/4381.wav|EN-US|EN| People can get them if they want.
10k/wav/4388.wav|EN-US|EN| He would take up the bike.
10k/wav/439.wav|EN-US|EN| They would want to watch a winning team.
10k/wav/44.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the biggest came of my life.
10k/wav/4401.wav|EN-US|EN| We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
10k/wav/4428.wav|EN-US|EN| My mind was made up.
10k/wav/443.wav|EN-US|EN| Is there any prospect of this happening?
10k/wav/444.wav|EN-US|EN| I miss the freedom that art.
10k/wav/4440.wav|EN-US|EN| You forgot to hand it to them.
10k/wav/4450.wav|EN-US|EN| That is bound to happen.
10k/wav/4459.wav|EN-US|EN| I just want to do the kid book.
10k/wav/446.wav|EN-US|EN| They are very happy with the new settlement.
10k/wav/4461.wav|EN-US|EN| I have not come in to take over.
10k/wav/4470.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be taking a world light.
10k/wav/4484.wav|EN-US|EN| But he was a fellow working member of our staff.
10k/wav/4492.wav|EN-US|EN| My life has been destroyed.
10k/wav/4499.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to be more specific.
10k/wav/45.wav|EN-US|EN| They have got off with murder.
10k/wav/451.wav|EN-US|EN| It has become very confused.
10k/wav/4515.wav|EN-US|EN| In order to get there we have got to invest.
10k/wav/4526.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there is an issue isn't there?
10k/wav/4528.wav|EN-US|EN| Cut a net to go over onto.
10k/wav/4564.wav|EN-US|EN| She had no chance.
10k/wav/458.wav|EN-US|EN| I was so nervous.
10k/wav/4592.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very weighing report.
10k/wav/4601.wav|EN-US|EN| What can you say?
10k/wav/4604.wav|EN-US|EN| Actually, it's an amazing orchestra
10k/wav/4625.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
10k/wav/4650.wav|EN-US|EN| This would include insurance.
10k/wav/466.wav|EN-US|EN| But this was Rafiste.
10k/wav/4676.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
10k/wav/4677.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
10k/wav/4678.wav|EN-US|EN| Promises were not kept.
10k/wav/4681.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, we know now.
10k/wav/4685.wav|EN-US|EN| She goes to the opening of an envelope.
10k/wav/4688.wav|EN-US|EN| It is coming on very well.
10k/wav/4698.wav|EN-US|EN| We could not have asked for them anymore.
10k/wav/4699.wav|EN-US|EN| He's got the same story.
10k/wav/4708.wav|EN-US|EN| It is sending the wrong message to people.
10k/wav/4714.wav|EN-US|EN| I have so much respect for him.
10k/wav/4715.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a no before the show.
10k/wav/4717.wav|EN-US|EN| I was not a doner.
10k/wav/4718.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to get back into the Champions League.
10k/wav/4727.wav|EN-US|EN| There has been a fabric in between two.
10k/wav/4750.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you want us to do?
10k/wav/4755.wav|EN-US|EN| Which brings us to the point.
10k/wav/4769.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very happy with the result.
10k/wav/4771.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw it didn't work.
10k/wav/4776.wav|EN-US|EN| Now the system is right behind us.
10k/wav/4779.wav|EN-US|EN| when we started the album.
10k/wav/4788.wav|EN-US|EN| You should feel involved in our lives.
10k/wav/4790.wav|EN-US|EN| The home side didn't stand a chance.
10k/wav/4797.wav|EN-US|EN| They have enough intrusion at the time.
10k/wav/4809.wav|EN-US|EN| I putty is a wreck
10k/wav/4815.wav|EN-US|EN| We can just get on with our game.
10k/wav/4825.wav|EN-US|EN| One is investment, one is reform.
10k/wav/4827.wav|EN-US|EN| That can cost him a fortune.
10k/wav/4831.wav|EN-US|EN| His day had started much like any other Sunday.
10k/wav/484.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadhya was tucking his chances down yesterday.
10k/wav/4859.wav|EN-US|EN| That's not going to happen again.
10k/wav/4862.wav|EN-US|EN| Basically, the classical tradition won out.
10k/wav/4884.wav|EN-US|EN| What were we doing?
10k/wav/4887.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly he is keeping in touch.
10k/wav/4889.wav|EN-US|EN| I will be ridiculed.
10k/wav/4910.wav|EN-US|EN| The partnership was set up during the summer.
10k/wav/4915.wav|EN-US|EN| I'll sit on for two days.
10k/wav/4920.wav|EN-US|EN| On the face of it, this is excellent news.
10k/wav/4922.wav|EN-US|EN| We find this very sad.
10k/wav/4923.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact he took it very well.
10k/wav/4927.wav|EN-US|EN| He was good, but not that good.
10k/wav/4935.wav|EN-US|EN| A final agreement has not yet been completed.
10k/wav/4966.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a tragedy for the area.
10k/wav/4973.wav|EN-US|EN| Success in Scotland is important.
10k/wav/498.wav|EN-US|EN| You got to have everything inside, was he?
10k/wav/4980.wav|EN-US|EN| That will be the sweetness.
10k/wav/4983.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not seeing an image of the person, he said.
10k/wav/4985.wav|EN-US|EN| I may play with two players up, maybe not.
10k/wav/4996.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not an impression.
10k/wav/4999.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a problem.
10k/wav/5004.wav|EN-US|EN| It was too soon.
10k/wav/5012.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's make this clip.
10k/wav/502.wav|EN-US|EN| He is survived by his wife and two sons.
10k/wav/504.wav|EN-US|EN| We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
10k/wav/5051.wav|EN-US|EN| She died later on Monday.
10k/wav/5060.wav|EN-US|EN| Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
10k/wav/5072.wav|EN-US|EN| We played so well at times.
10k/wav/5094.wav|EN-US|EN| I know he tells us.
10k/wav/5102.wav|EN-US|EN| That is their new way forward.
10k/wav/5111.wav|EN-US|EN| This was all well and good.
10k/wav/5112.wav|EN-US|EN| He was indeed a fairly decent man.
10k/wav/5121.wav|EN-US|EN| We've been talking about one or two years.
10k/wav/5125.wav|EN-US|EN| Hek will be leading out the election after next.
10k/wav/514.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there were some allotment findings.
10k/wav/5141.wav|EN-US|EN| That never happens in real life.
10k/wav/5145.wav|EN-US|EN| No, you couldn't make it up.
10k/wav/5147.wav|EN-US|EN| The composer therefore believes he can do it.
10k/wav/5158.wav|EN-US|EN| Buying our way out is not an option.
10k/wav/5167.wav|EN-US|EN| All things are possible if you believe.
10k/wav/5171.wav|EN-US|EN| The company continues to grow.
10k/wav/5178.wav|EN-US|EN| Play Zintok Blue
10k/wav/5182.wav|EN-US|EN| They were lovely family.
10k/wav/5183.wav|EN-US|EN| It was even must in that home.
10k/wav/5198.wav|EN-US|EN| The selection process is still at a very early stage.
10k/wav/5210.wav|EN-US|EN| It is suitable and sensible.
10k/wav/5215.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a pause.
10k/wav/523.wav|EN-US|EN| They have now become the focus of each police inquiry.
10k/wav/5230.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope that doesn't happen.
10k/wav/5233.wav|EN-US|EN| He stands on Centre Court alone.
10k/wav/5234.wav|EN-US|EN| We want this place to work.
10k/wav/5243.wav|EN-US|EN| They are looking for partners.
10k/wav/5249.wav|EN-US|EN| We should do everything that is trick.
10k/wav/5250.wav|EN-US|EN| But we will have to look at ourselves.
10k/wav/5251.wav|EN-US|EN| She runs like her mother.
10k/wav/5263.wav|EN-US|EN| This called a goal, but we have to keep playing.
10k/wav/5265.wav|EN-US|EN| What's it going to be then?
10k/wav/5273.wav|EN-US|EN| They had seven children.
10k/wav/5276.wav|EN-US|EN| That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
10k/wav/5277.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not standing on me.
10k/wav/5292.wav|EN-US|EN| However he held up little hope that the government would take action.
10k/wav/5293.wav|EN-US|EN| Where comes the ten yacht?
10k/wav/5334.wav|EN-US|EN| Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
10k/wav/5336.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very proud of him.
10k/wav/5342.wav|EN-US|EN| We expect them to deliver for us.
10k/wav/5349.wav|EN-US|EN| I had another good day.
10k/wav/5351.wav|EN-US|EN| We certainly will need to watch him.
10k/wav/5353.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got a mixture of bath.
10k/wav/5366.wav|EN-US|EN| The performance is not there.
10k/wav/5395.wav|EN-US|EN| But I am a lot of other things too.
10k/wav/5398.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything else is a bonus.
10k/wav/5400.wav|EN-US|EN| Don't decide to oppress.
10k/wav/541.wav|EN-US|EN| Fount said the press officer.
10k/wav/5414.wav|EN-US|EN| This is rapidly becoming a fierce go.
10k/wav/5421.wav|EN-US|EN| Entries for the event are still being accepted.
10k/wav/5435.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not physical at all.
10k/wav/5437.wav|EN-US|EN| It was developed in the Gulf War.
10k/wav/5452.wav|EN-US|EN| A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
10k/wav/5468.wav|EN-US|EN| The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super imposition of a number of bows.
10k/wav/548.wav|EN-US|EN| He had a different agenda entirely.
10k/wav/5480.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been in an awesome home for two years.
10k/wav/5492.wav|EN-US|EN| They are looking at a flotation.
10k/wav/5500.wav|EN-US|EN| That option cannot be read out.
10k/wav/5518.wav|EN-US|EN| People will make up their reminders.
10k/wav/5519.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps we should do the same.
10k/wav/5524.wav|EN-US|EN| But there is good and bad.
10k/wav/5528.wav|EN-US|EN| Who will perform?
10k/wav/5536.wav|EN-US|EN| Sprinters are not fit.
10k/wav/554.wav|EN-US|EN| However, Sharon rejected the claims.
10k/wav/5542.wav|EN-US|EN| Sex offender programs to be retained by public sector.
10k/wav/5545.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland needs the sort.
10k/wav/5547.wav|EN-US|EN| This was not the show for me.
10k/wav/555.wav|EN-US|EN| You can expect a hell of a fuss.
10k/wav/5550.wav|EN-US|EN| He took away my childhood.
10k/wav/5554.wav|EN-US|EN| After that answer, she resigned.
10k/wav/5556.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not true to Hollywood nor the player.
10k/wav/5557.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot to believe what has happened.
10k/wav/5564.wav|EN-US|EN| You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
10k/wav/5565.wav|EN-US|EN| We all thought we were going today.
10k/wav/5567.wav|EN-US|EN| He loved the moment.
10k/wav/5573.wav|EN-US|EN| We run within the law.
10k/wav/5576.wav|EN-US|EN| Four years is a long time.
10k/wav/5583.wav|EN-US|EN| Weaknesses there are, however.
10k/wav/5586.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a very strong metaphor.
10k/wav/5596.wav|EN-US|EN| One thing is clear.
10k/wav/5608.wav|EN-US|EN| Does it really matter?
10k/wav/5611.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very full anyway
10k/wav/5622.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a very high number.
10k/wav/5624.wav|EN-US|EN| I took a mini bus into town.
10k/wav/5633.wav|EN-US|EN| He was in contention almost every week.
10k/wav/565.wav|EN-US|EN| He served in the Gulf, the Falklands and Northern Ireland.
10k/wav/5659.wav|EN-US|EN| It's quite crucial for me.
10k/wav/5663.wav|EN-US|EN| So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
10k/wav/5675.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, until recently he didn't think so.
10k/wav/5679.wav|EN-US|EN| It was like a way too rich.
10k/wav/5685.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't even have the first idea.
10k/wav/5687.wav|EN-US|EN| A friendship that will end here.
10k/wav/5688.wav|EN-US|EN| But we were in control at that point.
10k/wav/5690.wav|EN-US|EN| The reason, of course, was the rock.
10k/wav/5691.wav|EN-US|EN| No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
10k/wav/5693.wav|EN-US|EN| The striker needed attention before he could resume.
10k/wav/5701.wav|EN-US|EN| That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
10k/wav/571.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps it is the crime estate.
10k/wav/5722.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully, no one will suffer too badly.
10k/wav/5725.wav|EN-US|EN| The Russian described his defeat as a bad day at the office.
10k/wav/5732.wav|EN-US|EN| The poor is no awkward with us.
10k/wav/5736.wav|EN-US|EN| He is the only one he must learn.
10k/wav/5739.wav|EN-US|EN| He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
10k/wav/5741.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been there.
10k/wav/5744.wav|EN-US|EN| It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
10k/wav/5752.wav|EN-US|EN| We had Ted Fauci.
10k/wav/5754.wav|EN-US|EN| People were very confused.
10k/wav/5757.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a real threat.
10k/wav/5769.wav|EN-US|EN| Inventories are coming under control.
10k/wav/5770.wav|EN-US|EN| That might happen in Pakistan, but in Proton.
10k/wav/5778.wav|EN-US|EN| When I went down I knew it was part
10k/wav/5781.wav|EN-US|EN| She is fulfilled by it.
10k/wav/5796.wav|EN-US|EN| They will remember this victory for a while.
10k/wav/5810.wav|EN-US|EN| I told you I was there.
10k/wav/583.wav|EN-US|EN| Why place is in the kitchen?
10k/wav/5832.wav|EN-US|EN| He edited the press release.
10k/wav/5833.wav|EN-US|EN| You've rowed camperling man.
10k/wav/5851.wav|EN-US|EN| That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
10k/wav/5861.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing has changed from the season before.
10k/wav/5868.wav|EN-US|EN| We begin as ever with a reminder of the end.
10k/wav/5870.wav|EN-US|EN| He is doing just that.
10k/wav/5874.wav|EN-US|EN| It was good today.
10k/wav/5879.wav|EN-US|EN| I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald too.
10k/wav/5880.wav|EN-US|EN| That is why we are here.
10k/wav/5895.wav|EN-US|EN| This court has made an order which has not been observed.
10k/wav/5928.wav|EN-US|EN| You can see the appeal of running away.
10k/wav/5933.wav|EN-US|EN| It was started almost by accident.
10k/wav/5950.wav|EN-US|EN| These matters are now behind us.
10k/wav/5959.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just one man
10k/wav/596.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just a failing service.
10k/wav/5966.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not doing it too well either.
10k/wav/5977.wav|EN-US|EN| It seemed like four hours.
10k/wav/5989.wav|EN-US|EN| I know that you have a love of Scotland.
10k/wav/6021.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a unique election.
10k/wav/6059.wav|EN-US|EN| A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
10k/wav/6080.wav|EN-US|EN| We are present a wide range of society.
10k/wav/609.wav|EN-US|EN| He was at home with his pals.
10k/wav/6094.wav|EN-US|EN| Something has to get some time.
10k/wav/6095.wav|EN-US|EN| People come to see the Harlem's.
10k/wav/6115.wav|EN-US|EN| They went good to you, Mole, too.
10k/wav/6119.wav|EN-US|EN| She could easily have been killed.
10k/wav/6127.wav|EN-US|EN| He had no answer.
10k/wav/6130.wav|EN-US|EN| The changes took effect from June.
10k/wav/6131.wav|EN-US|EN| I can see their argument.
10k/wav/6147.wav|EN-US|EN| Would that be for men and women?
10k/wav/6152.wav|EN-US|EN| Adventure is the champagne of life.
10k/wav/6177.wav|EN-US|EN| However, no further action was taken by police.
10k/wav/6183.wav|EN-US|EN| We went straight into the bedroom.
10k/wav/6185.wav|EN-US|EN| I haven't had a cake at a Celtic play for a while.
10k/wav/6188.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't possible to relax.
10k/wav/6201.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, life has changed a lot.
10k/wav/6224.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a stroke of genius.
10k/wav/6229.wav|EN-US|EN| The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the gender.
10k/wav/6232.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, life would be a lot less restrictive.
10k/wav/6241.wav|EN-US|EN| At some point, the bill will be presented.
10k/wav/6256.wav|EN-US|EN| To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
10k/wav/6274.wav|EN-US|EN| That took about two years.
10k/wav/629.wav|EN-US|EN| They first met during a step in London
10k/wav/6301.wav|EN-US|EN| I think they have got it completely right.
10k/wav/6311.wav|EN-US|EN| Surely the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
10k/wav/6325.wav|EN-US|EN| He did his job.
10k/wav/6327.wav|EN-US|EN| You've obviously got an answer to it.
10k/wav/6333.wav|EN-US|EN| Anything less will not do.
10k/wav/6339.wav|EN-US|EN| Experience in this work is paramount.
10k/wav/6368.wav|EN-US|EN| I was surprised that it has taken this approach.
10k/wav/6369.wav|EN-US|EN| I have to hand it to the bank.
10k/wav/6372.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the voice of the survivors.
10k/wav/6377.wav|EN-US|EN| This decision is a false.
10k/wav/6398.wav|EN-US|EN| She will get through it, I assure.
10k/wav/6400.wav|EN-US|EN| The neoners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
10k/wav/6416.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps it is in a mortgage bank.
10k/wav/6430.wav|EN-US|EN| There were three boys and two girls.
10k/wav/6459.wav|EN-US|EN| The government does not go far enough.
10k/wav/6481.wav|EN-US|EN| This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
10k/wav/6483.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the new Edinburgh.
10k/wav/6490.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is the Anthax?
10k/wav/6501.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no suggestion of any sense to intent on his birth.
10k/wav/6511.wav|EN-US|EN| I fell in love with it right away.
10k/wav/6512.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
10k/wav/6517.wav|EN-US|EN| But they must believe in themselves.
10k/wav/6519.wav|EN-US|EN| I had never done anything like it before.
10k/wav/6526.wav|EN-US|EN| They had not been handcuffed.
10k/wav/6527.wav|EN-US|EN| I love the game.
10k/wav/6533.wav|EN-US|EN| I need them to set my career.
10k/wav/6542.wav|EN-US|EN| They could change him tomorrow.
10k/wav/6553.wav|EN-US|EN| That was not perfect cold by any means.
10k/wav/6565.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
10k/wav/6567.wav|EN-US|EN| The Parliament will make its own decisions.
10k/wav/6571.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it will make a huge difference.
10k/wav/6583.wav|EN-US|EN| I suggest a new plan.
10k/wav/6589.wav|EN-US|EN| It is highly unlikely.
10k/wav/6590.wav|EN-US|EN| We were not going to take that risk.
10k/wav/6592.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never had problems with any football managers.
10k/wav/6601.wav|EN-US|EN| That view is held by many others within the industry.
10k/wav/6615.wav|EN-US|EN| which he can do.
10k/wav/6618.wav|EN-US|EN| Victory, she insisted yesterday was far more important than the rewards.
10k/wav/664.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe the cup is no need there.
10k/wav/6647.wav|EN-US|EN| He also had a Scottish grandfather.
10k/wav/665.wav|EN-US|EN| What were they told?
10k/wav/6652.wav|EN-US|EN| They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
10k/wav/6663.wav|EN-US|EN| That was no surprise to me.
10k/wav/667.wav|EN-US|EN| And they had a case.
10k/wav/6682.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workman-like.
10k/wav/6684.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think it could be clearer.
10k/wav/6690.wav|EN-US|EN| But my daughter has got nothing.
10k/wav/6692.wav|EN-US|EN| But he rejected calls for a public register of podophils.
10k/wav/6725.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Mill is married with three children.
10k/wav/6734.wav|EN-US|EN| He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
10k/wav/6739.wav|EN-US|EN| He took a jolly cigarette.
10k/wav/6751.wav|EN-US|EN| It all started with a visiting rock boot club.
10k/wav/678.wav|EN-US|EN| You should always be able to get out in some direction.
10k/wav/6798.wav|EN-US|EN| He was a lovely man.
10k/wav/6799.wav|EN-US|EN| No details of the talks were given.
10k/wav/6812.wav|EN-US|EN| The rest is on.
10k/wav/6813.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an amazing afternoon.
10k/wav/682.wav|EN-US|EN| The shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
10k/wav/6823.wav|EN-US|EN| The second is the reaction of the hips fans.
10k/wav/6831.wav|EN-US|EN| So, what do we go from here?
10k/wav/6840.wav|EN-US|EN| But in fact, the reverse is true.
10k/wav/6844.wav|EN-US|EN| What's sit about?
10k/wav/6850.wav|EN-US|EN| I hadn't seen them in 8 years.
10k/wav/686.wav|EN-US|EN| We will continue to provide support for them.
10k/wav/6864.wav|EN-US|EN| Tyr was certainly under attack from within his own party.
10k/wav/6872.wav|EN-US|EN| I've enjoyed the whole experience.
10k/wav/6890.wav|EN-US|EN| It may not even be possible.
10k/wav/6896.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think so.
10k/wav/6924.wav|EN-US|EN| Our policy is already working well.
10k/wav/6934.wav|EN-US|EN| I was very pleased with our display
10k/wav/694.wav|EN-US|EN| From our point of view, it's the right time.
10k/wav/6950.wav|EN-US|EN| On reflection, it is more than that.
10k/wav/6957.wav|EN-US|EN| Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
10k/wav/6968.wav|EN-US|EN| I gave him a wout and he took it.
10k/wav/6969.wav|EN-US|EN| I know I was in a very special position.
10k/wav/7000.wav|EN-US|EN| I had to lie.
10k/wav/7017.wav|EN-US|EN| We did not talk about it.
10k/wav/7022.wav|EN-US|EN| It is really special to me.
10k/wav/7025.wav|EN-US|EN| She had to learn a new discipline.
10k/wav/7028.wav|EN-US|EN| It is three years.
10k/wav/7047.wav|EN-US|EN| He is pretty upset.
10k/wav/7049.wav|EN-US|EN| Music is all consuming.
10k/wav/705.wav|EN-US|EN| It was all in a short period of time.
10k/wav/7050.wav|EN-US|EN| The other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
10k/wav/7065.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a lack of confidence.
10k/wav/7067.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Plunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
10k/wav/7077.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been the year of the Junster and Kilmarnock.
10k/wav/7081.wav|EN-US|EN| The likelihood is that it will be negative.
10k/wav/7085.wav|EN-US|EN| And the funny thing is, they literally do.
10k/wav/71.wav|EN-US|EN| Offers of company costs and other benefits have also become quite common.
10k/wav/7110.wav|EN-US|EN| Both reports are paired in the British Medical Journal.
10k/wav/7116.wav|EN-US|EN| Those people must be accountable.
10k/wav/7117.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know why she is not her.
10k/wav/7122.wav|EN-US|EN| No person was charged.
10k/wav/7125.wav|EN-US|EN| He has never let them down.
10k/wav/7139.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be the final push.
10k/wav/7146.wav|EN-US|EN| We are just waiting for her reaction.
10k/wav/7163.wav|EN-US|EN| That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
10k/wav/7171.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a bit of a struggle today.
10k/wav/7173.wav|EN-US|EN| But it looks good for next year.
10k/wav/7175.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to have a sense of humor.
10k/wav/719.wav|EN-US|EN| Sullivan was later charged with her mother, which she denied.
10k/wav/7197.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be fun.
10k/wav/7205.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be no backing down.
10k/wav/7221.wav|EN-US|EN| They are a victim of their own success.
10k/wav/7228.wav|EN-US|EN| His legal rights visa was also not in court yesterday.
10k/wav/7236.wav|EN-US|EN| Understood that concern.
10k/wav/7247.wav|EN-US|EN| Shimi returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with the torch.
10k/wav/7261.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a crisis.
10k/wav/7266.wav|EN-US|EN| That got me out of jail.
10k/wav/7267.wav|EN-US|EN| It became difficult for me.
10k/wav/7275.wav|EN-US|EN| It is an old family habit.
10k/wav/7281.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not easy to live in Russia.
10k/wav/7287.wav|EN-US|EN| We did not want an absentoo landlord.
10k/wav/7291.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just not funny.
10k/wav/7295.wav|EN-US|EN| I am going to help out in the summer as producer.
10k/wav/7307.wav|EN-US|EN| It's their duty to protect them.
10k/wav/7335.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not blaming audiences.
10k/wav/736.wav|EN-US|EN| You can see it on the training ground and now under the hotel
10k/wav/7368.wav|EN-US|EN| We know about the crisis in Carto.
10k/wav/7377.wav|EN-US|EN| However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
10k/wav/7385.wav|EN-US|EN| The industry is not well organised.
10k/wav/7392.wav|EN-US|EN| We must stop it with the golf ball.
10k/wav/7411.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a new confidence about the clop.
10k/wav/7427.wav|EN-US|EN| Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
10k/wav/7429.wav|EN-US|EN| The second is freedom.
10k/wav/7441.wav|EN-US|EN| The action reflects a slump in bookings.
10k/wav/7442.wav|EN-US|EN| What has changed since then?
10k/wav/7445.wav|EN-US|EN| This time, however, there is a new venue
10k/wav/7458.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not possible.
10k/wav/7466.wav|EN-US|EN| Did he always want to be a comedian?
10k/wav/748.wav|EN-US|EN| My players are special.
10k/wav/7480.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a real problem.
10k/wav/7493.wav|EN-US|EN| Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
10k/wav/7499.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't have many to get to town.
10k/wav/7514.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not interested in dividends.
10k/wav/7517.wav|EN-US|EN| You'd think there was a match on today.
10k/wav/7526.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the turning point of the afternoon.
10k/wav/7530.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been trying not to think about that.
10k/wav/7545.wav|EN-US|EN| In the end we did not spend a penny on him.
10k/wav/7548.wav|EN-US|EN| The cold war is over.
10k/wav/7552.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the context of his remarks.
10k/wav/7562.wav|EN-US|EN| He will make a statement on the dispute in the comments tomorrow.
10k/wav/7569.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the root of their problems.
10k/wav/7592.wav|EN-US|EN| This can be extreme.
10k/wav/7612.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just complete to your haste.
10k/wav/7621.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a ban on reporting the trail.
10k/wav/7625.wav|EN-US|EN| It was another black day for Hoshar.
10k/wav/7630.wav|EN-US|EN| They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
10k/wav/7638.wav|EN-US|EN| We have lost the round but not the fight.
10k/wav/7645.wav|EN-US|EN| Oakeson would have approved.
10k/wav/7654.wav|EN-US|EN| It traces search.
10k/wav/766.wav|EN-US|EN| The mud in approach will also be reflected in the toms of address.
10k/wav/7671.wav|EN-US|EN| We've not won anything yet.
10k/wav/7683.wav|EN-US|EN| upon to turn all secretary last September.
10k/wav/7691.wav|EN-US|EN| Last year I was pretty bad.
10k/wav/7692.wav|EN-US|EN| Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
10k/wav/7721.wav|EN-US|EN| Today, however, half of them get this financial help
10k/wav/7733.wav|EN-US|EN| That remains the same.
10k/wav/7741.wav|EN-US|EN| Standard life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
10k/wav/7752.wav|EN-US|EN| The fans pay for their season tickets.
10k/wav/7757.wav|EN-US|EN| The law will take its cause.
10k/wav/7778.wav|EN-US|EN| Anil has delivered
10k/wav/778.wav|EN-US|EN| This is Welcome News.
10k/wav/7784.wav|EN-US|EN| There are no quick fixes.
10k/wav/7787.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not going to get carried away.
10k/wav/7792.wav|EN-US|EN| Frankly, we should all have such problems.
10k/wav/7794.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very very frustrating.
10k/wav/7811.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a financial issue.
10k/wav/7832.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been traders with the lawyers.
10k/wav/7839.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a case to answer.
10k/wav/7859.wav|EN-US|EN| We aim to put them out of business.
10k/wav/7865.wav|EN-US|EN| Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
10k/wav/7868.wav|EN-US|EN| It is an amazing response.
10k/wav/7870.wav|EN-US|EN| The island will never recover.
10k/wav/7872.wav|EN-US|EN| who reminded him about this call.
10k/wav/7873.wav|EN-US|EN| It is after all, a very funny play.
10k/wav/7874.wav|EN-US|EN| That should give me a chance.
10k/wav/7905.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a matter of each concern.
10k/wav/7909.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it is no longer with the national team.
10k/wav/7910.wav|EN-US|EN| So far the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
10k/wav/7916.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no confusion over the second.
10k/wav/7930.wav|EN-US|EN| The support of Broton is assumed.
10k/wav/7936.wav|EN-US|EN| For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
10k/wav/7978.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be no receivers
10k/wav/7986.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not an easy life.
10k/wav/8016.wav|EN-US|EN| His English counterpart agreed.
10k/wav/8025.wav|EN-US|EN| Six men will take the decision.
10k/wav/8043.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a quality player.
10k/wav/8051.wav|EN-US|EN| But there has never been the time, she said.
10k/wav/8057.wav|EN-US|EN| He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
10k/wav/8074.wav|EN-US|EN| He set the move forward to downturn in business travel.
10k/wav/8080.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be very damaging for research.
10k/wav/8099.wav|EN-US|EN| If you can run a computer you can talk to the world.
10k/wav/810.wav|EN-US|EN| We have done a deal with impact.
10k/wav/8105.wav|EN-US|EN| He raised the profile of the European top to the sky.
10k/wav/8106.wav|EN-US|EN| Actually, nothing much will change
10k/wav/8117.wav|EN-US|EN| The stadium was full.
10k/wav/8130.wav|EN-US|EN| I am interested in interesting work.
10k/wav/815.wav|EN-US|EN| He enjoyed being with his family.
10k/wav/8151.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an interesting title, believing in Britain.
10k/wav/8155.wav|EN-US|EN| They've raised just a nonsense.
10k/wav/8164.wav|EN-US|EN| His son is a local legend.
10k/wav/8177.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to expect this type of thing.
10k/wav/820.wav|EN-US|EN| But we are not similar to the problem.
10k/wav/8207.wav|EN-US|EN| Its fast awards will just do that.
10k/wav/8217.wav|EN-US|EN| It was decided he should be dismissed.
10k/wav/8225.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd already had them all
10k/wav/8261.wav|EN-US|EN| The story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
10k/wav/8265.wav|EN-US|EN| and he has a tilt to tell
10k/wav/8266.wav|EN-US|EN| And we had a good response.
10k/wav/8271.wav|EN-US|EN| No, it's alright.
10k/wav/8278.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a winner.
10k/wav/8289.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to wait.
10k/wav/8291.wav|EN-US|EN| I've done it all.
10k/wav/8305.wav|EN-US|EN| The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
10k/wav/8321.wav|EN-US|EN| What's the theme?
10k/wav/8325.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a relief.
10k/wav/8332.wav|EN-US|EN| Puma was not amazed.
10k/wav/8359.wav|EN-US|EN| I nearly meant it.
10k/wav/8361.wav|EN-US|EN| The system can work.
10k/wav/8373.wav|EN-US|EN| In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
10k/wav/8384.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem is labour.
10k/wav/839.wav|EN-US|EN| That takes time and games and practice.
10k/wav/8397.wav|EN-US|EN| Even the ones you loved.
10k/wav/8402.wav|EN-US|EN| If it's not, they didn't go far enough
10k/wav/8407.wav|EN-US|EN| Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
10k/wav/8419.wav|EN-US|EN| I had surprised to hear it from Tenny.
10k/wav/8420.wav|EN-US|EN| I was never going to play against Scotland.
10k/wav/843.wav|EN-US|EN| Further heavy charges are expected this year.
10k/wav/8462.wav|EN-US|EN| Shops can go.
10k/wav/847.wav|EN-US|EN| He spoke about the choices facing them and no contrary.
10k/wav/8476.wav|EN-US|EN| We have not been approached.
10k/wav/848.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an accident.
10k/wav/8487.wav|EN-US|EN| A new school will be built.
10k/wav/8489.wav|EN-US|EN| New York is my home.
10k/wav/8490.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very difficult to find a buyer.
10k/wav/8525.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel really good.
10k/wav/8539.wav|EN-US|EN| We are a new department.
10k/wav/8591.wav|EN-US|EN| The capital costs are modest.
10k/wav/8600.wav|EN-US|EN| Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
10k/wav/8605.wav|EN-US|EN| This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
10k/wav/8607.wav|EN-US|EN| The media has been great.
10k/wav/8608.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not against a further inquiry.
10k/wav/8612.wav|EN-US|EN| The first half was depressing.
10k/wav/8634.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe she is right.
10k/wav/8645.wav|EN-US|EN| That has now come.
10k/wav/8654.wav|EN-US|EN| I keep my fingers crossed.
10k/wav/8656.wav|EN-US|EN| The incidents are not believed to be linked.
10k/wav/8657.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no intention of resigning today.
10k/wav/8665.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be nice to be involved in another victory.
10k/wav/8672.wav|EN-US|EN| I shouldn't have to put up with it.
10k/wav/8685.wav|EN-US|EN| Or rather, it isn't.
10k/wav/8689.wav|EN-US|EN| That's been our position all along.
10k/wav/869.wav|EN-US|EN| Both players gave so much to the site.
10k/wav/8700.wav|EN-US|EN| This means a lot of hard decisions.
10k/wav/8718.wav|EN-US|EN| Stardom is a funny thing.
10k/wav/873.wav|EN-US|EN| This produces exactly the opposite effect.
10k/wav/8730.wav|EN-US|EN| On Thursday, Mr Blow will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
10k/wav/8731.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that such a bad thing?
10k/wav/8732.wav|EN-US|EN| The removal would take place in France.
10k/wav/8735.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither side can win this war.
10k/wav/8741.wav|EN-US|EN| We are open in an inquiry.
10k/wav/8753.wav|EN-US|EN| I would not say that.
10k/wav/8755.wav|EN-US|EN| I will always remember the horrible images.
10k/wav/8777.wav|EN-US|EN| She was just that sort of person.
10k/wav/8780.wav|EN-US|EN| That doesn't happen in Europe.
10k/wav/8794.wav|EN-US|EN| I have signed a contract.
10k/wav/8797.wav|EN-US|EN| Harry will be up for it.
10k/wav/8799.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't think he was being very fair.
10k/wav/8813.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure he will be aware of it
10k/wav/8845.wav|EN-US|EN| The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
10k/wav/8861.wav|EN-US|EN| They played it like a cop final.
10k/wav/8865.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to chat
10k/wav/8873.wav|EN-US|EN| They held on for many years.
10k/wav/8875.wav|EN-US|EN| People buy everything with cash.
10k/wav/8881.wav|EN-US|EN| I was living with my mum.
10k/wav/8893.wav|EN-US|EN| The second failed completely.
10k/wav/8907.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm looking forward to that.
10k/wav/8932.wav|EN-US|EN| It is believed she had serious head injuries.
10k/wav/8948.wav|EN-US|EN| There, you were just a body.
10k/wav/8949.wav|EN-US|EN| I want a clue.
10k/wav/8960.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a minor incident.
10k/wav/8979.wav|EN-US|EN| I begot to get noticed.
10k/wav/8990.wav|EN-US|EN| Was this element always though?
10k/wav/9002.wav|EN-US|EN| Won't he be given time?
10k/wav/9008.wav|EN-US|EN| We kept going right to the final whistle.
10k/wav/9011.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the Chemick.
10k/wav/9014.wav|EN-US|EN| I took my chance
10k/wav/9017.wav|EN-US|EN| My only consent is for my children.
10k/wav/9025.wav|EN-US|EN| For once, you should believe the hope.
10k/wav/9030.wav|EN-US|EN| They will have to cut through the roof.
10k/wav/9038.wav|EN-US|EN| We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
10k/wav/9048.wav|EN-US|EN| Money is not everything in life.
10k/wav/9054.wav|EN-US|EN| We never said that we would walk through the 3rd Division.
10k/wav/9058.wav|EN-US|EN| All these women were actors.
10k/wav/9068.wav|EN-US|EN| Adats be the memorial.
10k/wav/9074.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm pleased to be in them.
10k/wav/9083.wav|EN-US|EN| A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
10k/wav/9090.wav|EN-US|EN| The state would provide
10k/wav/9103.wav|EN-US|EN| I was there for five hours.
10k/wav/9127.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the way.
10k/wav/9131.wav|EN-US|EN| Work has started.
10k/wav/9133.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
10k/wav/9136.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a traffic cordon.
10k/wav/9160.wav|EN-US|EN| I was very pleased with them today though.
10k/wav/9174.wav|EN-US|EN| He realizes his mistake.
10k/wav/9183.wav|EN-US|EN| They received a reply from their own managers.
10k/wav/9189.wav|EN-US|EN| I leave tonight for England.
10k/wav/920.wav|EN-US|EN| It just isn't either.
10k/wav/9206.wav|EN-US|EN| They have just got to believe in themselves.
10k/wav/9209.wav|EN-US|EN| But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.
10k/wav/9213.wav|EN-US|EN| A former decision will be announced through their months.
10k/wav/9217.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole thing is utterly transparent.
10k/wav/9238.wav|EN-US|EN| She is given a new Deputy Minister for Transport and Planning.
10k/wav/9243.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a monument to the past.
10k/wav/9251.wav|EN-US|EN| They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
10k/wav/9266.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very very lucky to be alive.
10k/wav/9276.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no smoking gun.
10k/wav/9284.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no happy ending.
10k/wav/9287.wav|EN-US|EN| He has not been dropped.
10k/wav/9300.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure that this will happen again
10k/wav/9319.wav|EN-US|EN| It was considered to be topical.
10k/wav/9325.wav|EN-US|EN| There could be a way back
10k/wav/9335.wav|EN-US|EN| It's got to be in the HUD.
10k/wav/9338.wav|EN-US|EN| The jury is still out on this one
10k/wav/9344.wav|EN-US|EN| Is he going to look after them?
10k/wav/9354.wav|EN-US|EN| We were caught together.
10k/wav/9361.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was not all bad news.
10k/wav/9366.wav|EN-US|EN| She is a veteran in the Balkans.
10k/wav/9371.wav|EN-US|EN| But things are never the same again.
10k/wav/938.wav|EN-US|EN| We only are a team.
10k/wav/9392.wav|EN-US|EN| The Vastbokovitz funds are run by Aberdeen.
10k/wav/9395.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is a similar problem.
10k/wav/9400.wav|EN-US|EN| It is, that the lot is not clear-cut.
10k/wav/9405.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything is coming together well.
10k/wav/9422.wav|EN-US|EN| What has caused the demise of sinning?
10k/wav/9429.wav|EN-US|EN| However, you never know.
10k/wav/9431.wav|EN-US|EN| They're interested in nonprofits.
10k/wav/9443.wav|EN-US|EN| We will not break even.
10k/wav/9446.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you not forget about Monica?
10k/wav/9452.wav|EN-US|EN| There was something special about that
10k/wav/946.wav|EN-US|EN| It depends on the decisions of the member states.
10k/wav/9463.wav|EN-US|EN| Trading places was too obvious.
10k/wav/9470.wav|EN-US|EN| Break the budget record.
10k/wav/9471.wav|EN-US|EN| It made me determined to get back.
10k/wav/9496.wav|EN-US|EN| And the match was not too bad, either.
10k/wav/9498.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been there already.
10k/wav/95.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a step on the way.
10k/wav/9551.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a recipe for success.
10k/wav/9585.wav|EN-US|EN| In the end we made two minios
10k/wav/9612.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
10k/wav/9634.wav|EN-US|EN| He is the example for all of us.
10k/wav/9638.wav|EN-US|EN| I know a lot of people who don't.
10k/wav/9641.wav|EN-US|EN| They never gave up hope.
10k/wav/9642.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no hint of scandal.
10k/wav/9673.wav|EN-US|EN| We already have them, I hope.
10k/wav/9675.wav|EN-US|EN| They may have been murdered.
10k/wav/9681.wav|EN-US|EN| There are no second chances.
10k/wav/9683.wav|EN-US|EN| After that, we made some changes.
10k/wav/9693.wav|EN-US|EN| Now suddenly, we have this new landscape.
10k/wav/9698.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's teach us to do something different.
10k/wav/9706.wav|EN-US|EN| Daryl was, however, adamant.
10k/wav/9716.wav|EN-US|EN| And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
10k/wav/9718.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Cook, left away in the Fromproton, would be ideally placed.
10k/wav/9721.wav|EN-US|EN| I was checking on the blocks.
10k/wav/9740.wav|EN-US|EN| I intend to end it on the high.
10k/wav/9743.wav|EN-US|EN| We wanted to run away with her.
10k/wav/9764.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole thing was just some row.
10k/wav/9765.wav|EN-US|EN| From that down we started to look for another fill back.
10k/wav/9772.wav|EN-US|EN| On the grant, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
10k/wav/9787.wav|EN-US|EN| We cannot either these things.
10k/wav/9800.wav|EN-US|EN| It looks like a river.
10k/wav/9811.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't believe it.
10k/wav/9826.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, that's just a third district.
10k/wav/9827.wav|EN-US|EN| The red cart was okay.
10k/wav/9840.wav|EN-US|EN| Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
10k/wav/9845.wav|EN-US|EN| He null is in fan work inertia.
10k/wav/9846.wav|EN-US|EN| That should not be their conclusion.
10k/wav/9849.wav|EN-US|EN| He could tell you.
10k/wav/9858.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody can get at them there.
10k/wav/9869.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a wealthy person.
10k/wav/9870.wav|EN-US|EN| Singing has gone out of fashion.
10k/wav/9871.wav|EN-US|EN| In her opinion the rich are different.
10k/wav/9916.wav|EN-US|EN| The occasion was the new Labour conference in Brighton last year.
10k/wav/9944.wav|EN-US|EN| There are some good people in there.
10k/wav/9950.wav|EN-US|EN| This remains the party's policy.
10k/wav/9988.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted with today's win.
10k/wav/9990.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody in the world can get away from him.
10k/wav/1021.wav|EN-US|EN| He doesn't have to like it but he must accept it.
10k/wav/1026.wav|EN-US|EN| The results are sometimes contentious.
10k/wav/1027.wav|EN-US|EN| There was badly closed on Sunday.
10k/wav/1030.wav|EN-US|EN| It has the potential to be another North Sea.
10k/wav/1032.wav|EN-US|EN| It appears that their holiday is complete without a good row.
10k/wav/1035.wav|EN-US|EN| All of us know it exists.
10k/wav/1054.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope he comes back
10k/wav/1055.wav|EN-US|EN| No decision on that was taken.
10k/wav/1061.wav|EN-US|EN| I certainly think it should be there.
10k/wav/1095.wav|EN-US|EN| The season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
10k/wav/112.wav|EN-US|EN| It was properly reported to us.
10k/wav/1131.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the same in Sweden.
10k/wav/1135.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not the fault of one man, of course.
10k/wav/1136.wav|EN-US|EN| I have made that offer.
10k/wav/1147.wav|EN-US|EN| The bombing has had a huge influence.
10k/wav/1162.wav|EN-US|EN| It was important to win today.
10k/wav/1166.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
10k/wav/1183.wav|EN-US|EN| He had no problem with alcohol.
10k/wav/1206.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm constantly changing my mind.
10k/wav/1229.wav|EN-US|EN| For the moment however the position is clear.
10k/wav/1233.wav|EN-US|EN| I would think they are just behind them.
10k/wav/1235.wav|EN-US|EN| That is our unfinished business.
10k/wav/1252.wav|EN-US|EN| I do my job.
10k/wav/1262.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone was in tears.
10k/wav/1267.wav|EN-US|EN| Pearl is a decision for me.
10k/wav/1275.wav|EN-US|EN| It may encourage more people to prospect.
10k/wav/1276.wav|EN-US|EN| Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
10k/wav/1283.wav|EN-US|EN| The Trust has no magic wand.
10k/wav/1285.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a team to reach the final.
10k/wav/1291.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the first time they met.
10k/wav/1314.wav|EN-US|EN| In a way he was.
10k/wav/1316.wav|EN-US|EN| In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help in progress.
10k/wav/1322.wav|EN-US|EN| But we are confident.
10k/wav/1331.wav|EN-US|EN| The treat was rather different.
10k/wav/1336.wav|EN-US|EN| The place became a war zone.
10k/wav/1339.wav|EN-US|EN| The issue has yet to be resolved.
10k/wav/1354.wav|EN-US|EN| Treatment is not an issue with these people.
10k/wav/1363.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not caught anyone.
10k/wav/1367.wav|EN-US|EN| The real enemy is a neuron backyard.
10k/wav/1371.wav|EN-US|EN| And Markoel was just great.
10k/wav/1374.wav|EN-US|EN| I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
10k/wav/1381.wav|EN-US|EN| This will be great for the young lads.
10k/wav/1392.wav|EN-US|EN| It is deeply frustrating.
10k/wav/1395.wav|EN-US|EN| Things can change.
10k/wav/1396.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
10k/wav/1410.wav|EN-US|EN| It deserves to be a winner.
10k/wav/1412.wav|EN-US|EN| as many as the market will support.
10k/wav/1420.wav|EN-US|EN| We have great sympathy with Danny.
10k/wav/1426.wav|EN-US|EN| Therefore it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
10k/wav/1436.wav|EN-US|EN| So what did he do?
10k/wav/1440.wav|EN-US|EN| He's very confident at the moment.
10k/wav/1451.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very good.
10k/wav/1461.wav|EN-US|EN| No one knows the numbers.
10k/wav/1471.wav|EN-US|EN| Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
10k/wav/1477.wav|EN-US|EN| This is all part of opening the door.
10k/wav/1480.wav|EN-US|EN| We know we cannot rely on thee.
10k/wav/1493.wav|EN-US|EN| We believe we have a strong case.
10k/wav/150.wav|EN-US|EN| Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
10k/wav/1508.wav|EN-US|EN| It is homegrown.
10k/wav/1533.wav|EN-US|EN| The fight is underway.
10k/wav/1534.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no casualties.
10k/wav/1542.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope we can still find a solution.
10k/wav/1543.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a reporter for us.
10k/wav/1559.wav|EN-US|EN| On my day I can beat anyone.
10k/wav/1568.wav|EN-US|EN| He was the youngest of the British team.
10k/wav/1571.wav|EN-US|EN| That could change.
10k/wav/1581.wav|EN-US|EN| They have been forced to walk.
10k/wav/1582.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem is Wes is Scotland.
10k/wav/1591.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows we are not much of a rugby country.
10k/wav/1618.wav|EN-US|EN| Was this a new event?
10k/wav/1623.wav|EN-US|EN| There's already booked for next year.
10k/wav/1624.wav|EN-US|EN| 30 people have applied for his job.
10k/wav/1640.wav|EN-US|EN| They have broken the promise.
10k/wav/1644.wav|EN-US|EN| No decision has yet been made.
10k/wav/1673.wav|EN-US|EN| Equipment is also a problem.
10k/wav/1683.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, he is an artist.
10k/wav/1697.wav|EN-US|EN| People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
10k/wav/1700.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to get the right people in.
10k/wav/1702.wav|EN-US|EN| I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
10k/wav/1703.wav|EN-US|EN| My life is going to go on.
10k/wav/1732.wav|EN-US|EN| He is an excellent defender, strong and quick
10k/wav/1739.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a tough old job to get through a faster job.
10k/wav/1744.wav|EN-US|EN| I hadn't had that before.
10k/wav/1745.wav|EN-US|EN| When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
10k/wav/1754.wav|EN-US|EN| The wingers must have felt the cold.
10k/wav/1762.wav|EN-US|EN| I would welcome a proper public discussion on this issue.
10k/wav/1787.wav|EN-US|EN| We could have had no new money.
10k/wav/1788.wav|EN-US|EN| Play is a set of actions.
10k/wav/1790.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a marketing scheme.
10k/wav/18.wav|EN-US|EN| suddenly there was an audience
10k/wav/1806.wav|EN-US|EN| Slope lenses are to be avoided.
10k/wav/1824.wav|EN-US|EN| The death toll included five children.
10k/wav/1832.wav|EN-US|EN| He was the home referee.
10k/wav/1833.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland has shown the way.
10k/wav/1872.wav|EN-US|EN| Someone to cast.
10k/wav/1878.wav|EN-US|EN| Certainly, there is much on the gender.
10k/wav/1882.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not going to back off.
10k/wav/1884.wav|EN-US|EN| It isn't a free for all.
10k/wav/1903.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not long enough.
10k/wav/1910.wav|EN-US|EN| The answer is obviously no.
10k/wav/1925.wav|EN-US|EN| We all know they could do it.
10k/wav/1937.wav|EN-US|EN| We sell family men with children.
10k/wav/1945.wav|EN-US|EN| At the top of the structure, we'll regain the post of headature.
10k/wav/195.wav|EN-US|EN| I expected a victory. The pain is enormous.
10k/wav/1953.wav|EN-US|EN| He sent the right things.
10k/wav/1964.wav|EN-US|EN| There can be no compromise on welfare.
10k/wav/1988.wav|EN-US|EN| It's hardly a new strategy in our practice.
10k/wav/2007.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got this cool holiday song.
10k/wav/2020.wav|EN-US|EN| It opens the door to the Champions League.
10k/wav/2025.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been a wake-up call for the sector this week.
10k/wav/2026.wav|EN-US|EN| I dispute this with the company, not the travelling public.
10k/wav/2028.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very pleased with what we have achieved.
10k/wav/203.wav|EN-US|EN| I've beheld it all before.
10k/wav/2045.wav|EN-US|EN| We still have to wait for that.
10k/wav/2050.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a move which appealed to him.
10k/wav/2072.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
10k/wav/2080.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very very dejected.
10k/wav/2085.wav|EN-US|EN| A lot of people had to wait and people still do.
10k/wav/2095.wav|EN-US|EN| We like being the underdogs.
10k/wav/2096.wav|EN-US|EN| The hill process was so different.
10k/wav/2101.wav|EN-US|EN| And that brings us to the point.
10k/wav/2102.wav|EN-US|EN| Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
10k/wav/2107.wav|EN-US|EN| As I'm going with all three.
10k/wav/2119.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that an issue?
10k/wav/2120.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody ever knew it had happened.
10k/wav/2130.wav|EN-US|EN| Entries from the event are still being accepted.
10k/wav/2143.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not holding the club to write some.
10k/wav/2144.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a matter of chance.
10k/wav/2150.wav|EN-US|EN| It was different in the endurance events.
10k/wav/2151.wav|EN-US|EN| Kids are terrible.
10k/wav/2155.wav|EN-US|EN| We have no plans for decked action.
10k/wav/2157.wav|EN-US|EN| Five years ago its return was rejected.
10k/wav/2178.wav|EN-US|EN| And there are others.
10k/wav/2179.wav|EN-US|EN| They were badgy prepared for it.
10k/wav/2187.wav|EN-US|EN| He was dead on arrival at hospital.
10k/wav/2199.wav|EN-US|EN| We still think this trade is on the increase.
10k/wav/2205.wav|EN-US|EN| All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
10k/wav/2209.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought it was a great game.
10k/wav/2211.wav|EN-US|EN| What are you waiting for?
10k/wav/2215.wav|EN-US|EN| She didn't tell us anything, Nee.
10k/wav/2227.wav|EN-US|EN| Alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
10k/wav/2239.wav|EN-US|EN| He ended up a headmaster.
10k/wav/224.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not a diva.
10k/wav/2241.wav|EN-US|EN| It has great potential.
10k/wav/2250.wav|EN-US|EN| So is there anything left to say?
10k/wav/2273.wav|EN-US|EN| Have you tried everything?
10k/wav/2279.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe in trade unions.
10k/wav/2286.wav|EN-US|EN| I can appear to be nice and lovely.
10k/wav/2300.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a journey into new life.
10k/wav/2303.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to put myself on discussion also.
10k/wav/2324.wav|EN-US|EN| The calls were last night rejected by theirs and duck.
10k/wav/2341.wav|EN-US|EN| The men are safe and in hand.
10k/wav/2344.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a Leomato scale.
10k/wav/2345.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a great addition to our team.
10k/wav/2347.wav|EN-US|EN| It isn't our own luns.
10k/wav/2348.wav|EN-US|EN| Access has been a nightmare.
10k/wav/2351.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to keep him.
10k/wav/2355.wav|EN-US|EN| Ike's Ferguson is the same.
10k/wav/2368.wav|EN-US|EN| An alternative must be offered.
10k/wav/2378.wav|EN-US|EN| Next League Matches, Aberdeen Dundee United
10k/wav/2388.wav|EN-US|EN| Strictly speaking, it sure didn't be like this.
10k/wav/2390.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, that was the plan.
10k/wav/2393.wav|EN-US|EN| It was however the wrong side.
10k/wav/2398.wav|EN-US|EN| It is part of this game.
10k/wav/2401.wav|EN-US|EN| I seldom need to get out of bed.
10k/wav/2410.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to reduce the number of plastic backs.
10k/wav/2452.wav|EN-US|EN| It is mainstream.
10k/wav/2456.wav|EN-US|EN| They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
10k/wav/2464.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a you've turn.
10k/wav/2477.wav|EN-US|EN| It is no surprise at all.
10k/wav/2480.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lack of logic.
10k/wav/2492.wav|EN-US|EN| Special measures were needed.
10k/wav/2493.wav|EN-US|EN| You did not change overnight.
10k/wav/2494.wav|EN-US|EN| I was a bit nervous.
10k/wav/250.wav|EN-US|EN| He has gone through the process before.
10k/wav/2509.wav|EN-US|EN| No one else used it since then.
10k/wav/2514.wav|EN-US|EN| It is having a big impact.
10k/wav/2521.wav|EN-US|EN| Cast is too expensive.
10k/wav/2524.wav|EN-US|EN| We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
10k/wav/254.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to regroup.
10k/wav/2569.wav|EN-US|EN| There is nothing wrong with that.
10k/wav/2574.wav|EN-US|EN| If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
10k/wav/2586.wav|EN-US|EN| Hollywood Comedy is having a good week.
10k/wav/261.wav|EN-US|EN| This latter suggestion is very important.
10k/wav/2615.wav|EN-US|EN| Collops need to have their own drug abuse policies.
10k/wav/2635.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem rises because he does so much.
10k/wav/264.wav|EN-US|EN| Italy would be lukewarm.
10k/wav/2645.wav|EN-US|EN| And does it even matter?
10k/wav/265.wav|EN-US|EN| There's nothing to be gained by it.
10k/wav/2660.wav|EN-US|EN| We had a grand view.
10k/wav/2676.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a result we should serve all.
10k/wav/269.wav|EN-US|EN| The nine minutes before halftime Kenny Miller's truck
10k/wav/2691.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it does not seem to be the case
10k/wav/2702.wav|EN-US|EN| There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
10k/wav/2713.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
10k/wav/2726.wav|EN-US|EN| and not pro company needs to have its orchestra.
10k/wav/2727.wav|EN-US|EN| And so it is with young companies.
10k/wav/2730.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the plates should have a voice in these matters
10k/wav/2742.wav|EN-US|EN| I never found my rhythm
10k/wav/2744.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it is a great shame.
10k/wav/275.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to win the group.
10k/wav/2772.wav|EN-US|EN| It was hopeless.
10k/wav/2781.wav|EN-US|EN| Are we not men?
10k/wav/2791.wav|EN-US|EN| This one was supposed to be so different.
10k/wav/2793.wav|EN-US|EN| On this form they have a real chance of going up.
10k/wav/2795.wav|EN-US|EN| No, they have played well.
10k/wav/2800.wav|EN-US|EN| There are so many unanswered questions.
10k/wav/2813.wav|EN-US|EN| Tini Plo, Can you see her face?
10k/wav/2815.wav|EN-US|EN| Our season is not finished.
10k/wav/2822.wav|EN-US|EN| Only two players have done it.
10k/wav/2827.wav|EN-US|EN| You encourage them so you can do it.
10k/wav/2835.wav|EN-US|EN| My father died in childbirth.
10k/wav/2838.wav|EN-US|EN| He is married with one daughter and this infant.
10k/wav/2842.wav|EN-US|EN| They would have to go to the role.
10k/wav/2849.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very exciting.
10k/wav/2860.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not a position they enjoy.
10k/wav/2862.wav|EN-US|EN| They are not always the same person.
10k/wav/2865.wav|EN-US|EN| She failed to win any of them.
10k/wav/287.wav|EN-US|EN| That's not the intention at all.
10k/wav/289.wav|EN-US|EN| They told him to go to drama school.
10k/wav/2902.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a matter of time.
10k/wav/2904.wav|EN-US|EN| His name has not been released.
10k/wav/291.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the high point of my career.
10k/wav/2931.wav|EN-US|EN| We are taking no chances this time.
10k/wav/2939.wav|EN-US|EN| It's because they can't understand the long good.
10k/wav/2953.wav|EN-US|EN| You do need a check and a balance.
10k/wav/2964.wav|EN-US|EN| But when we did, it is great.
10k/wav/2975.wav|EN-US|EN| The United Nations must act.
10k/wav/2977.wav|EN-US|EN| They said we were soft touch.
10k/wav/2980.wav|EN-US|EN| The maul of the euchos of Olmi is beginning to crack.
10k/wav/3007.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
10k/wav/3008.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the performance we want.
10k/wav/3011.wav|EN-US|EN| The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.
10k/wav/3012.wav|EN-US|EN| He has a lot of experience as captain in this grey.
10k/wav/3047.wav|EN-US|EN| Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
10k/wav/3057.wav|EN-US|EN| The force is with them.
10k/wav/3058.wav|EN-US|EN| If true, it will be the first sign of descent.
10k/wav/3062.wav|EN-US|EN| This happened on 3 days inside a week.
10k/wav/3063.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
10k/wav/3066.wav|EN-US|EN| The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Leibol.
10k/wav/3070.wav|EN-US|EN| That might mean another delay.
10k/wav/308.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't know it was his edition, but it was.
10k/wav/3083.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe his time has gone.
10k/wav/3091.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is a slow process.
10k/wav/3109.wav|EN-US|EN| That can be good for us.
10k/wav/3120.wav|EN-US|EN| All our futures will already have been decided.
10k/wav/3135.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to have a go.
10k/wav/314.wav|EN-US|EN| The next week is crucial.
10k/wav/3143.wav|EN-US|EN| Cloning is not ready.
10k/wav/3157.wav|EN-US|EN| Teachers have been given offer.
10k/wav/3165.wav|EN-US|EN| We were short of athletes.
10k/wav/3174.wav|EN-US|EN| If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
10k/wav/3178.wav|EN-US|EN| He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
10k/wav/3185.wav|EN-US|EN| No other country has ever won this tournament.
10k/wav/3196.wav|EN-US|EN| I want this one to be different.
10k/wav/32.wav|EN-US|EN| He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
10k/wav/3201.wav|EN-US|EN| Friends of the family have given their support.
10k/wav/321.wav|EN-US|EN| We recognised the importance rule of golf in attracting visitors.
10k/wav/3210.wav|EN-US|EN| I would do away with the dress kit.
10k/wav/3222.wav|EN-US|EN| As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
10k/wav/3226.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a question of fashion.
10k/wav/3235.wav|EN-US|EN| It will include the pluck watch, the Royal Collins Regiment.
10k/wav/3237.wav|EN-US|EN| The fast was excluding Symphon.
10k/wav/3241.wav|EN-US|EN| Their campaign isn't to say
10k/wav/3255.wav|EN-US|EN| He is not a pathetic figure.
10k/wav/3276.wav|EN-US|EN| That is no bad thing.
10k/wav/3308.wav|EN-US|EN| Beth were later released after a check's up
10k/wav/3320.wav|EN-US|EN| No one was injured.
10k/wav/3322.wav|EN-US|EN| The loss temp trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
10k/wav/3325.wav|EN-US|EN| Then it was the ten of the crime of all.
10k/wav/3327.wav|EN-US|EN| The proposals have been taken out of context.
10k/wav/3334.wav|EN-US|EN| He put a lot of effort into it.
10k/wav/3343.wav|EN-US|EN| Weather should not be factor.
10k/wav/3346.wav|EN-US|EN| The answer is maybe.
10k/wav/3351.wav|EN-US|EN| What the depositment of transport will make clear.
10k/wav/3357.wav|EN-US|EN| But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
10k/wav/3372.wav|EN-US|EN| with the stores or public property.
10k/wav/3381.wav|EN-US|EN| Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
10k/wav/3387.wav|EN-US|EN| He was just like a godfather tit.
10k/wav/3393.wav|EN-US|EN| Thomas was his friend.
10k/wav/3403.wav|EN-US|EN| They tend to be easily influenced by others.
10k/wav/3419.wav|EN-US|EN| It's part of your life.
10k/wav/3423.wav|EN-US|EN| People look, but no one ever finds it.
10k/wav/3437.wav|EN-US|EN| So far, it is no more.
10k/wav/344.wav|EN-US|EN| I am just asking them to improve their disciplines.
10k/wav/3441.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
10k/wav/3444.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a difficult thing to explain.
10k/wav/3454.wav|EN-US|EN| How can you want to make the mistake again?
10k/wav/3460.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been very patient.
10k/wav/3475.wav|EN-US|EN| I only wanted to give her fright.
10k/wav/3488.wav|EN-US|EN| We live by the rule of law.
10k/wav/3492.wav|EN-US|EN| This does not help.
10k/wav/351.wav|EN-US|EN| He was between people uncut.
10k/wav/3518.wav|EN-US|EN| That brought a wonderful marriage of bus in Supromo.
10k/wav/3554.wav|EN-US|EN| This makes up for it.
10k/wav/3556.wav|EN-US|EN| These days are past.
10k/wav/3590.wav|EN-US|EN| We cannot ask for them back.
10k/wav/3594.wav|EN-US|EN| but they will need to play to score.
10k/wav/36.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a fit in front of the camera.
10k/wav/3602.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no basis for the rest.
10k/wav/3606.wav|EN-US|EN| The weaknesses are few.
10k/wav/3609.wav|EN-US|EN| Meteorists will bypass this in advance.
10k/wav/3614.wav|EN-US|EN| But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
10k/wav/3615.wav|EN-US|EN| It would then be up to the judge.
10k/wav/3621.wav|EN-US|EN| I see that to any day now.
10k/wav/3642.wav|EN-US|EN| Now that would impress the kids.
10k/wav/3643.wav|EN-US|EN| He pretended not to care.
10k/wav/3646.wav|EN-US|EN| He died for multiple injuries.
10k/wav/3647.wav|EN-US|EN| The talking cannot go on too long.
10k/wav/3651.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the theory.
10k/wav/3672.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Pell was asked at almost a yoga.
10k/wav/3681.wav|EN-US|EN| He is involved in everything.
10k/wav/3701.wav|EN-US|EN| This does not create any precedent.
10k/wav/3707.wav|EN-US|EN| All credit to them. They took their chances. We didn't.
10k/wav/3759.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a test in itself.
10k/wav/3765.wav|EN-US|EN| After about a year the feeling returned to my finger.
10k/wav/3772.wav|EN-US|EN| But my heart is in athletics.
10k/wav/3773.wav|EN-US|EN| either sorry to hear this news
10k/wav/3795.wav|EN-US|EN| Colin says you get rid of the date today by looking at the future.
10k/wav/3798.wav|EN-US|EN| Pensions are a long-term investment
10k/wav/380.wav|EN-US|EN| At far my many, he was not the man of the match.
10k/wav/3804.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the bit that's from.
10k/wav/3805.wav|EN-US|EN| This here the exercise is being repeated.
10k/wav/3813.wav|EN-US|EN| They treated me with respect and courtesy.
10k/wav/3827.wav|EN-US|EN| I am delighted for Andy.
10k/wav/3858.wav|EN-US|EN| He could have given them a lot.
10k/wav/3864.wav|EN-US|EN| Their job is to show whether any disease remains.
10k/wav/3867.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a game of confidence.
10k/wav/3878.wav|EN-US|EN| The success of the OpenEye has enabled the business to expand.
10k/wav/3887.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a precedent for the fairy.
10k/wav/389.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully he will be back in contention next week.
10k/wav/3933.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no energy behind it.
10k/wav/3946.wav|EN-US|EN| It is understood he had been stopped.
10k/wav/3948.wav|EN-US|EN| The end result is the same
10k/wav/3956.wav|EN-US|EN| They just thought it was extremely good acting.
10k/wav/3977.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very popular in England and abroad.
10k/wav/398.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the end of a chapter and it is very sad
10k/wav/3984.wav|EN-US|EN| I can make one for the announcement.
10k/wav/4.wav|EN-US|EN| This would not be my first choice.
10k/wav/4005.wav|EN-US|EN| Petrol prices were widely blamed.
10k/wav/4010.wav|EN-US|EN| Where does it come from?
10k/wav/4012.wav|EN-US|EN| This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
10k/wav/4013.wav|EN-US|EN| I've got a young family.
10k/wav/4034.wav|EN-US|EN| We have the location which is the charade.
10k/wav/404.wav|EN-US|EN| So we talked about that for a bit.
10k/wav/4042.wav|EN-US|EN| He did very well but didn't win.
10k/wav/406.wav|EN-US|EN| Does this mean?
10k/wav/4069.wav|EN-US|EN| Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
10k/wav/4074.wav|EN-US|EN| They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
10k/wav/409.wav|EN-US|EN| Our goal was very important to the team.
10k/wav/4091.wav|EN-US|EN| And how he kept his word.
10k/wav/4098.wav|EN-US|EN| That did not go down well.
10k/wav/4103.wav|EN-US|EN| He is also a great finisher.
10k/wav/4117.wav|EN-US|EN| It was that kind of war.
10k/wav/4121.wav|EN-US|EN| I just felt the time was broken down.
10k/wav/4122.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the same with Barry.
10k/wav/4131.wav|EN-US|EN| But with thy not the same person.
10k/wav/4132.wav|EN-US|EN| whether this return was too soon.
10k/wav/4133.wav|EN-US|EN| It is par for the course, of course.
10k/wav/4138.wav|EN-US|EN| She was not hard done by.
10k/wav/4188.wav|EN-US|EN| The initial reaction was disbelief.
10k/wav/4208.wav|EN-US|EN| It's side of labour.
10k/wav/4215.wav|EN-US|EN| I also thought this is a feature film.
10k/wav/4228.wav|EN-US|EN| That does not take much training.
10k/wav/4231.wav|EN-US|EN| They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
10k/wav/4237.wav|EN-US|EN| Just get on with your job.
10k/wav/4254.wav|EN-US|EN| They desperately want some stability.
10k/wav/4275.wav|EN-US|EN| Clicially, they, united, were still alive.
10k/wav/4292.wav|EN-US|EN| I'll end to wait to recover fully
10k/wav/4300.wav|EN-US|EN| We keep a distance.
10k/wav/4301.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not like that at all.
10k/wav/4302.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we're so long way far out.
10k/wav/4304.wav|EN-US|EN| The big issue for us is the review.
10k/wav/4305.wav|EN-US|EN| He had no problems with discipline.
10k/wav/4321.wav|EN-US|EN| What do they pay to join the club?
10k/wav/4341.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
10k/wav/4345.wav|EN-US|EN| Of further privacy, he had no need
10k/wav/4347.wav|EN-US|EN| We are all very proud of her.
10k/wav/4353.wav|EN-US|EN| You are going to take away my life.
10k/wav/4358.wav|EN-US|EN| More likely perhaps is that he will stay in England.
10k/wav/4365.wav|EN-US|EN| We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
10k/wav/4366.wav|EN-US|EN| Two years ago, the Commission did not want to get involved.
10k/wav/437.wav|EN-US|EN| I managed to tick her completely by surprise.
10k/wav/4371.wav|EN-US|EN| Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots
10k/wav/4372.wav|EN-US|EN| We know the fight is going to happen.
10k/wav/4382.wav|EN-US|EN| Highland Healthport has a responsibility there.
10k/wav/4390.wav|EN-US|EN| He changed mouth.
10k/wav/4392.wav|EN-US|EN| We still don't you know?
10k/wav/4397.wav|EN-US|EN| Only injury has prevented that happening before.
10k/wav/4400.wav|EN-US|EN| I read it every year.
10k/wav/4405.wav|EN-US|EN| Tavis is very supportive as a director.
10k/wav/4406.wav|EN-US|EN| It can all be done over the phone.
10k/wav/441.wav|EN-US|EN| Leipart cruised the Tory leader of panicking.
10k/wav/4416.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a great feeling right now.
10k/wav/4419.wav|EN-US|EN| This should put downward pressure on inflation.
10k/wav/4424.wav|EN-US|EN| sell to cost simply trying to buy time by not paying the money
10k/wav/4429.wav|EN-US|EN| Tarleton Day is not a Scottish event.
10k/wav/4452.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not up to speed.
10k/wav/4464.wav|EN-US|EN| Nature will not find its own level.
10k/wav/4469.wav|EN-US|EN| There did not need to be a miracle.
10k/wav/4491.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
10k/wav/4496.wav|EN-US|EN| I the knots putting myself down.
10k/wav/4504.wav|EN-US|EN| Not so, he insisted.
10k/wav/4505.wav|EN-US|EN| He is indeed the grind son of Trevor Linkfic.
10k/wav/4508.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't have any regrets about the edit.
10k/wav/4511.wav|EN-US|EN| Plot samples were taken.
10k/wav/4513.wav|EN-US|EN| Either system could have prevented the crash
10k/wav/4520.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a soap opera.
10k/wav/4522.wav|EN-US|EN| The direct effects on trade will be limited.
10k/wav/4535.wav|EN-US|EN| I have got a wafta feet.
10k/wav/4539.wav|EN-US|EN| How would it work?
10k/wav/454.wav|EN-US|EN| Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
10k/wav/4543.wav|EN-US|EN| with I just delighted to be back on top.
10k/wav/455.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't want to know how it's happened
10k/wav/4551.wav|EN-US|EN| It is sad and frustrating.
10k/wav/456.wav|EN-US|EN| He could face a changed sentence.
10k/wav/4567.wav|EN-US|EN| The hotel was each.
10k/wav/4571.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't want to bury all servers.
10k/wav/4573.wav|EN-US|EN| The price cuts are really exciting.
10k/wav/4582.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you thought?
10k/wav/4584.wav|EN-US|EN| I want somebody with something to pipe.
10k/wav/4598.wav|EN-US|EN| Glasgow then took control.
10k/wav/4602.wav|EN-US|EN| That's probably the hot bit about being dropped.
10k/wav/4619.wav|EN-US|EN| That tells you something about them.
10k/wav/4623.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to happen.
10k/wav/4626.wav|EN-US|EN| The team's prompt with Waseer last year is a gankut.
10k/wav/4634.wav|EN-US|EN| She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
10k/wav/464.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a white report.
10k/wav/465.wav|EN-US|EN| Look at the potential of this glob.
10k/wav/4654.wav|EN-US|EN| Closure is not one of them
10k/wav/4655.wav|EN-US|EN| They have given up.
10k/wav/4701.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a story.
10k/wav/4707.wav|EN-US|EN| My daughter is an adult.
10k/wav/471.wav|EN-US|EN| So now we know the secret.
10k/wav/4713.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
10k/wav/4722.wav|EN-US|EN| You can't get the experience in Austria.
10k/wav/4728.wav|EN-US|EN| My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
10k/wav/4730.wav|EN-US|EN| In many ways it was disastrous.
10k/wav/4732.wav|EN-US|EN| The precedent will not be removed from office.
10k/wav/4733.wav|EN-US|EN| I certainly think it's very short to sighted.
10k/wav/4739.wav|EN-US|EN| He said she was mutt.
10k/wav/4745.wav|EN-US|EN| I can understand Philip that rangers and salt at quant to progress.
10k/wav/4746.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot wait for it to come out.
10k/wav/475.wav|EN-US|EN| An appeal was unlikely.
10k/wav/4757.wav|EN-US|EN| He hooked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
10k/wav/4783.wav|EN-US|EN| On our numbers, the price is a name with the asset value.
10k/wav/4792.wav|EN-US|EN| There was too much at stake.
10k/wav/4805.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot really commit.
10k/wav/481.wav|EN-US|EN| The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
10k/wav/4829.wav|EN-US|EN| They will be stopped and they will be punished.
10k/wav/4830.wav|EN-US|EN| They were only there for three weeks.
10k/wav/4832.wav|EN-US|EN| It has not come.
10k/wav/4837.wav|EN-US|EN| She was also very brave.
10k/wav/4842.wav|EN-US|EN| We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
10k/wav/488.wav|EN-US|EN| token chastures of tiny tax cuts will not do
10k/wav/489.wav|EN-US|EN| This is thought to mean some time next week.
10k/wav/4899.wav|EN-US|EN| Don't even bother applying.
10k/wav/490.wav|EN-US|EN| That seems highly unlikely.
10k/wav/4903.wav|EN-US|EN| to me it was just a miracle
10k/wav/4907.wav|EN-US|EN| Some people begin to turn away to go home.
10k/wav/4925.wav|EN-US|EN| The contrary is in a state of case.
10k/wav/4944.wav|EN-US|EN| It's about my time as a guitarist.
10k/wav/4956.wav|EN-US|EN| We will not simply hate these people.
10k/wav/4964.wav|EN-US|EN| This should begin in October.
10k/wav/4969.wav|EN-US|EN| This kind of traffic is commonplace.
10k/wav/4972.wav|EN-US|EN| It is my last chance.
10k/wav/4986.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly it is time to meet this young man.
10k/wav/5011.wav|EN-US|EN| There was only one living room you see
10k/wav/5026.wav|EN-US|EN| I am extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
10k/wav/5033.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
10k/wav/5040.wav|EN-US|EN| We had a really good experience with David.
10k/wav/5048.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully today will be the turning point.
10k/wav/5075.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm getting loned in the teeth.
10k/wav/5084.wav|EN-US|EN| You didn't need to pay.
10k/wav/5091.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
10k/wav/511.wav|EN-US|EN| I need Donald, do I?
10k/wav/5120.wav|EN-US|EN| Jackson may I be right?
10k/wav/5138.wav|EN-US|EN| I think the overall picture is still as tall.
10k/wav/5157.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a fight to the death.
10k/wav/5170.wav|EN-US|EN| The ambition this year is to improve on last.
10k/wav/5173.wav|EN-US|EN| I am astonished by this decision.
10k/wav/5176.wav|EN-US|EN| Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
10k/wav/5177.wav|EN-US|EN| Nelson does not disappoint.
10k/wav/5179.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not a Paedophile.
10k/wav/5189.wav|EN-US|EN| This court was a penalty and a breakaway.
10k/wav/5191.wav|EN-US|EN| I had enough fun.
10k/wav/5214.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps it was just as well.
10k/wav/5224.wav|EN-US|EN| Paris is not a neon.
10k/wav/5231.wav|EN-US|EN| It is too much for me.
10k/wav/5235.wav|EN-US|EN| Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
10k/wav/5237.wav|EN-US|EN| They continue to do so.
10k/wav/5248.wav|EN-US|EN| She does not see anything ever changing.
10k/wav/5255.wav|EN-US|EN| I decided to take my time.
10k/wav/5267.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm really, really happy.
10k/wav/5280.wav|EN-US|EN| Meanwhile, the weather was causing White's threat disruption.
10k/wav/5288.wav|EN-US|EN| That has to take its tool.
10k/wav/5291.wav|EN-US|EN| He says that he is no different from any other man.
10k/wav/5297.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not sure they love it
10k/wav/53.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
10k/wav/5318.wav|EN-US|EN| The frustration was showing.
10k/wav/5324.wav|EN-US|EN| However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
10k/wav/5325.wav|EN-US|EN| Smith has not let him down.
10k/wav/5343.wav|EN-US|EN| She said she was really sorry.
10k/wav/5345.wav|EN-US|EN| The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
10k/wav/5361.wav|EN-US|EN| In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.
10k/wav/5362.wav|EN-US|EN| But you can go beyond that condition.
10k/wav/5363.wav|EN-US|EN| The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the compound increases as the size of the drops increases.
10k/wav/5375.wav|EN-US|EN| Both will be head at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
10k/wav/5376.wav|EN-US|EN| and do with anyway beforehand.
10k/wav/5405.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a great shame.
10k/wav/5413.wav|EN-US|EN| We deserve to get the victory today.
10k/wav/5425.wav|EN-US|EN| But no, it's not funny.
10k/wav/5428.wav|EN-US|EN| A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
10k/wav/5432.wav|EN-US|EN| that he loved a few days later.
10k/wav/5439.wav|EN-US|EN| The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
10k/wav/544.wav|EN-US|EN| Why hard work is the answer?
10k/wav/5460.wav|EN-US|EN| Or we could do a trade sale.
10k/wav/5464.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not perfect.
10k/wav/5467.wav|EN-US|EN| There is great demand for human cloning.
10k/wav/547.wav|EN-US|EN| when he came to see me on Monday.
10k/wav/5472.wav|EN-US|EN| It's never great to finish second.
10k/wav/5474.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a pretty terrible day.
10k/wav/5475.wav|EN-US|EN| He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
10k/wav/55.wav|EN-US|EN| It certainly was a birthday to remember.
10k/wav/556.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure it will go on.
10k/wav/5561.wav|EN-US|EN| He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.
10k/wav/5566.wav|EN-US|EN| You look at that.
10k/wav/5569.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you in this movie?
10k/wav/557.wav|EN-US|EN| She others will sincerely be injured.
10k/wav/5577.wav|EN-US|EN| The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
10k/wav/5580.wav|EN-US|EN| There is certainly no single arts hunting candidate.
10k/wav/5598.wav|EN-US|EN| You can never tell.
10k/wav/5606.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything in the world was focused on London.
10k/wav/5609.wav|EN-US|EN| It could be done by experts and lawyers.
10k/wav/561.wav|EN-US|EN| The performance continues to improve.
10k/wav/5614.wav|EN-US|EN| That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
10k/wav/5617.wav|EN-US|EN| Are we going mainstream?
10k/wav/5618.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an attitude thing.
10k/wav/5665.wav|EN-US|EN| It is simply not true.
10k/wav/5670.wav|EN-US|EN| We just have to adapt.
10k/wav/5684.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
10k/wav/5704.wav|EN-US|EN| I likely learned from one sticks.
10k/wav/5708.wav|EN-US|EN| We are trying to lessen the stigma.
10k/wav/5711.wav|EN-US|EN| Mark Catricech indicates that this is not feasible.
10k/wav/5713.wav|EN-US|EN| I have got to adopt the same approach.
10k/wav/5720.wav|EN-US|EN| There may be reasons for it.
10k/wav/5730.wav|EN-US|EN| I find the Songqing debate is demeaning.
10k/wav/5743.wav|EN-US|EN| It works as well.
10k/wav/5751.wav|EN-US|EN| The chosen one doesn't always excel
10k/wav/5759.wav|EN-US|EN| Each brand was owned by a different family.
10k/wav/5760.wav|EN-US|EN| We can walk all night.
10k/wav/5761.wav|EN-US|EN| The following day I used the story.
10k/wav/5762.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it was entirely the right decision.
10k/wav/5779.wav|EN-US|EN| A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
10k/wav/5784.wav|EN-US|EN| So they will settle again
10k/wav/5790.wav|EN-US|EN| Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
10k/wav/5793.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
10k/wav/5795.wav|EN-US|EN| The project is entitled The Complaiso in Scotland.
10k/wav/5806.wav|EN-US|EN| This should include procedures for personal imports.
10k/wav/5816.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very sorry to be here.
10k/wav/5820.wav|EN-US|EN| It could have been a hammering burner.
10k/wav/5886.wav|EN-US|EN| Chambers said he would accept the place.
10k/wav/5911.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a good day for the collision.
10k/wav/5915.wav|EN-US|EN| I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament
10k/wav/5939.wav|EN-US|EN| I think the euro has slept.
10k/wav/5947.wav|EN-US|EN| Was he confident about his prospects?
10k/wav/595.wav|EN-US|EN| Off with the huts.
10k/wav/5961.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't care to recall it
10k/wav/5968.wav|EN-US|EN| You may have a short memory.
10k/wav/5971.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
10k/wav/598.wav|EN-US|EN| They went and found reports that it was Carbus.
10k/wav/5980.wav|EN-US|EN| We know that from recent experience.
10k/wav/5984.wav|EN-US|EN| There would be a north and south division.
10k/wav/6020.wav|EN-US|EN| They have broken that promise.
10k/wav/6024.wav|EN-US|EN| We believe the squat will stay together.
10k/wav/6029.wav|EN-US|EN| Shunreet, the Scottish Secretary, also welcomed the news.
10k/wav/6043.wav|EN-US|EN| The wind was coming from all directions.
10k/wav/6045.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very ingenious.
10k/wav/6055.wav|EN-US|EN| He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
10k/wav/6056.wav|EN-US|EN| I just want to get rid of it.
10k/wav/6073.wav|EN-US|EN| Would they fall out?
10k/wav/6084.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not in the public interest.
10k/wav/6088.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very fast, alright.
10k/wav/6093.wav|EN-US|EN| Archo is no newcomer to the stage.
10k/wav/6098.wav|EN-US|EN| There were many positives for this club.
10k/wav/6110.wav|EN-US|EN| It may be good for the soul.
10k/wav/6112.wav|EN-US|EN| As agreed, the Prime Minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
10k/wav/6120.wav|EN-US|EN| We wanted it left for a while.
10k/wav/6136.wav|EN-US|EN| The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
10k/wav/614.wav|EN-US|EN| It helped me to get noticed.
10k/wav/6145.wav|EN-US|EN| He can perform well under pressure.
10k/wav/615.wav|EN-US|EN| I was shocked.
10k/wav/6165.wav|EN-US|EN| No partners would lose their jobs.
10k/wav/6173.wav|EN-US|EN| I love the thought of having a crocket defending the title.
10k/wav/6209.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the way things are hiding.
10k/wav/621.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted for Simon.
10k/wav/6228.wav|EN-US|EN| But I was glad to see these interviews.
10k/wav/6238.wav|EN-US|EN| Dancing will help his anchors and his feet.
10k/wav/6243.wav|EN-US|EN| Was it just negligent?
10k/wav/6265.wav|EN-US|EN| Why can't I never like this?
10k/wav/6272.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
10k/wav/6277.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the start of our season
10k/wav/6280.wav|EN-US|EN| It happens in real life.
10k/wav/6305.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just delighted to take it.
10k/wav/631.wav|EN-US|EN| Today we can say that a mirror has begun.
10k/wav/6324.wav|EN-US|EN| It should be cool.
10k/wav/6326.wav|EN-US|EN| What are you going to do exactly?
10k/wav/6329.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we can overcome it.
10k/wav/6330.wav|EN-US|EN| His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
10k/wav/6354.wav|EN-US|EN| But once again it was not converted.
10k/wav/6355.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just going to hit the shot.
10k/wav/6361.wav|EN-US|EN| They had been together for about three years.
10k/wav/6364.wav|EN-US|EN| We are delighted nothing else, just delighted.
10k/wav/6371.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
10k/wav/6375.wav|EN-US|EN| The concerns are the same.
10k/wav/6393.wav|EN-US|EN| We played them all in the Champions League
10k/wav/6396.wav|EN-US|EN| This is your life.
10k/wav/6399.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully, now we are getting it.
10k/wav/64.wav|EN-US|EN| Here's a global perspective.
10k/wav/6407.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to go for it.
10k/wav/6412.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot say too much about them.
10k/wav/6424.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think that's very fair.
10k/wav/6427.wav|EN-US|EN| We must do well in that.
10k/wav/6432.wav|EN-US|EN| We must convince the citizens.
10k/wav/6438.wav|EN-US|EN| You can maintain regular contact.
10k/wav/6439.wav|EN-US|EN| You would be wrong.
10k/wav/6444.wav|EN-US|EN| Sometimes it's not what you say that counts.
10k/wav/6454.wav|EN-US|EN| Consumers have the right to choose.
10k/wav/6456.wav|EN-US|EN| This may help in the short temper not beyond March.
10k/wav/6462.wav|EN-US|EN| You just have to give yourself a chance.
10k/wav/6471.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a big mystery.
10k/wav/6479.wav|EN-US|EN| There's much work to do.
10k/wav/6482.wav|EN-US|EN| That is this attitude to things.
10k/wav/6491.wav|EN-US|EN| A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
10k/wav/6503.wav|EN-US|EN| That was just one mutt.
10k/wav/653.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a prime name.
10k/wav/655.wav|EN-US|EN| David was not either.
10k/wav/6563.wav|EN-US|EN| We've railed no way.
10k/wav/657.wav|EN-US|EN| British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
10k/wav/6572.wav|EN-US|EN| We have all been shocked by our death.
10k/wav/6574.wav|EN-US|EN| It was my shortest addition.
10k/wav/658.wav|EN-US|EN| There are different cultures and different departments.
10k/wav/6581.wav|EN-US|EN| They were both delightful to work with.
10k/wav/6598.wav|EN-US|EN| I have my suspicions.
10k/wav/661.wav|EN-US|EN| The group is due to report by the end of the year.
10k/wav/6619.wav|EN-US|EN| It's quite a routine.
10k/wav/6622.wav|EN-US|EN| Why should we have been asked to show?
10k/wav/6635.wav|EN-US|EN| That is why it's so lyrical
10k/wav/6645.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
10k/wav/6653.wav|EN-US|EN| Or doing one line was very easy.
10k/wav/6664.wav|EN-US|EN| What? They maybe have three Scottish players.
10k/wav/6674.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm really happy with the way it worked.
10k/wav/6677.wav|EN-US|EN| Frankly that's not good enough.
10k/wav/6697.wav|EN-US|EN| The encounter was to change his life.
10k/wav/67.wav|EN-US|EN| The end result is precisely the same.
10k/wav/6704.wav|EN-US|EN| Again he dismissed a metric with Halifax.
10k/wav/6731.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no comment to make.
10k/wav/6736.wav|EN-US|EN| People remember the Tories in office.
10k/wav/675.wav|EN-US|EN| They wanted them to move fast, but some couldn't.
10k/wav/6777.wav|EN-US|EN| I was in the train station overnight.
10k/wav/6778.wav|EN-US|EN| The view is impressive.
10k/wav/6816.wav|EN-US|EN| It wouldn't be the last.
10k/wav/6835.wav|EN-US|EN| It looks as though he will be right.
10k/wav/6836.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a mental challenge.
10k/wav/6839.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not in my nature.
10k/wav/6873.wav|EN-US|EN| Back then it was hard to refuse.
10k/wav/6920.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't know where to look.
10k/wav/6947.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very very pleased with the response.
10k/wav/695.wav|EN-US|EN| Form and structure, eyes music
10k/wav/6955.wav|EN-US|EN| They discussed how he might get involved.
10k/wav/6958.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not getting him back.
10k/wav/6959.wav|EN-US|EN| Subnot used. Mic K.
10k/wav/6973.wav|EN-US|EN| There will always be in our hearts and in our motors.
10k/wav/6993.wav|EN-US|EN| It is understood they saw one body.
10k/wav/6998.wav|EN-US|EN| You can feel at home in January.
10k/wav/7016.wav|EN-US|EN| But he is frustrated at every turn.
10k/wav/7021.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully he will get a lucky break.
10k/wav/7046.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be retained as part of the group.
10k/wav/7052.wav|EN-US|EN| I was influenced by all these things.
10k/wav/7072.wav|EN-US|EN| Does it matter?
10k/wav/7073.wav|EN-US|EN| She is an imposing presence.
10k/wav/7078.wav|EN-US|EN| He denied that taxpayers' money was involved.
10k/wav/7086.wav|EN-US|EN| I got very, very tired
10k/wav/7106.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, there you go.
10k/wav/7131.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the place to play football.
10k/wav/7136.wav|EN-US|EN| No one should see that.
10k/wav/714.wav|EN-US|EN| We have learned a tremendous amount.
10k/wav/7142.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully this week will be good.
10k/wav/7160.wav|EN-US|EN| It used to be a hot cell.
10k/wav/7161.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a code
10k/wav/7178.wav|EN-US|EN| It will take a few years before we see the final benefit.
10k/wav/7183.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm confident that the state workers will have a secure future.
10k/wav/7194.wav|EN-US|EN| The lady is right.
10k/wav/7200.wav|EN-US|EN| He will provide the wine.
10k/wav/7206.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a very important and beautiful day.
10k/wav/7209.wav|EN-US|EN| Now they have to do something about it.
10k/wav/7214.wav|EN-US|EN| That's why he is a national treasure.
10k/wav/724.wav|EN-US|EN| It had so much to do with output.
10k/wav/7243.wav|EN-US|EN| If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
10k/wav/7248.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know what we are team around
10k/wav/7260.wav|EN-US|EN| The other conditions were not specified.
10k/wav/7262.wav|EN-US|EN| I was deeply white.
10k/wav/7268.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought he was terrific.
10k/wav/7277.wav|EN-US|EN| I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
10k/wav/7278.wav|EN-US|EN| And they did just that.
10k/wav/7298.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no formal announcements.
10k/wav/7303.wav|EN-US|EN| We were not allowed to go to help them.
10k/wav/7312.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish they would commit to us.
10k/wav/7343.wav|EN-US|EN| If he leaves, the bound is finished.
10k/wav/7374.wav|EN-US|EN| What's the rush?
10k/wav/7399.wav|EN-US|EN| He confirmed that there had been no warning.
10k/wav/7406.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not the end.
10k/wav/7410.wav|EN-US|EN| Thou art now divorced.
10k/wav/7416.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to lift the cup for the fans.
10k/wav/742.wav|EN-US|EN| That is European law.
10k/wav/7424.wav|EN-US|EN| The group is separate from the real low.
10k/wav/7431.wav|EN-US|EN| The thing is to recognize that chance.
10k/wav/7440.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a lot of numbers.
10k/wav/7443.wav|EN-US|EN| We could not compete with Rangers.
10k/wav/7450.wav|EN-US|EN| We deserve a significant choice.
10k/wav/7455.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be extremely difficult for him.
10k/wav/747.wav|EN-US|EN| Surely it can't get any worse.
10k/wav/7471.wav|EN-US|EN| It was quite an ordeal for them.
10k/wav/7478.wav|EN-US|EN| They just asked the wind.
10k/wav/7479.wav|EN-US|EN| But it will be sorted out this week.
10k/wav/749.wav|EN-US|EN| If I didn't clear for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
10k/wav/75.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot wait to get started on it.
10k/wav/7503.wav|EN-US|EN| I go home only once.
10k/wav/7508.wav|EN-US|EN| He did not have to stop and think.
10k/wav/7516.wav|EN-US|EN| I lie for today.
10k/wav/7519.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a real challenge.
10k/wav/7523.wav|EN-US|EN| Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
10k/wav/7539.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
10k/wav/7559.wav|EN-US|EN| Theatre is not a museum.
10k/wav/7568.wav|EN-US|EN| He needed a kidney, it is as simple as that.
10k/wav/7571.wav|EN-US|EN| Such actions are rarely popular.
10k/wav/7572.wav|EN-US|EN| We were leading by two goals.
10k/wav/7590.wav|EN-US|EN| They are being deported from their homes.
10k/wav/7594.wav|EN-US|EN| I said she was very young.
10k/wav/760.wav|EN-US|EN| Ivy got the shirt.
10k/wav/7624.wav|EN-US|EN| I get on him. He gets on me.
10k/wav/7632.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to be very careful.
10k/wav/7640.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not changing my mind.
10k/wav/7646.wav|EN-US|EN| It's that sort of night.
10k/wav/7665.wav|EN-US|EN| No, because it was too many.
10k/wav/7669.wav|EN-US|EN| I knew people on that committee.
10k/wav/7680.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the consistent approach of the government.
10k/wav/7694.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
10k/wav/7709.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not going to work out that way.
10k/wav/7726.wav|EN-US|EN| It will not work a second time.
10k/wav/773.wav|EN-US|EN| But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
10k/wav/7734.wav|EN-US|EN| The trick is to try it.
10k/wav/7736.wav|EN-US|EN| We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
10k/wav/774.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't know he was even at...
10k/wav/7746.wav|EN-US|EN| Six public bodies are behind the plan.
10k/wav/7756.wav|EN-US|EN| The problems are a result of that shortfall.
10k/wav/7759.wav|EN-US|EN| I enjoyed my luck in the Scottish office.
10k/wav/7773.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know what he was shouting.
10k/wav/7795.wav|EN-US|EN| It is something that we will put right.
10k/wav/7802.wav|EN-US|EN| The goal is clear.
10k/wav/781.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a very high price.
10k/wav/783.wav|EN-US|EN| It's amazing it's happened in the daytime.
10k/wav/7833.wav|EN-US|EN| The girl will come.
10k/wav/7840.wav|EN-US|EN| He was a great human being.
10k/wav/7841.wav|EN-US|EN| Are we here?
10k/wav/7853.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like inclusion in its underwear.
10k/wav/7861.wav|EN-US|EN| I am securing mine's position
10k/wav/7877.wav|EN-US|EN| What happens when the funding is exhausted?
10k/wav/7897.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly, that is important in nothing.
10k/wav/7901.wav|EN-US|EN| The pressure is enormous.
10k/wav/7904.wav|EN-US|EN| I will not be pressured.
10k/wav/7908.wav|EN-US|EN| The cell was not revealed.
10k/wav/7913.wav|EN-US|EN| But he made a mistake in picking it.
10k/wav/7920.wav|EN-US|EN| He says Stradit, we expect him to be jailed.
10k/wav/7921.wav|EN-US|EN| They have set the standard.
10k/wav/7922.wav|EN-US|EN| Adventure is the champagne of life.
10k/wav/7927.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not the greatest performance but it was effective.
10k/wav/7944.wav|EN-US|EN| David Sutherland does not beat about the perch.
10k/wav/7945.wav|EN-US|EN| If only we had known.
10k/wav/7948.wav|EN-US|EN| I forgot to hold mine hands up for this one.
10k/wav/7960.wav|EN-US|EN| That's why the ministers resigned.
10k/wav/7971.wav|EN-US|EN| It later was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
10k/wav/7983.wav|EN-US|EN| He wants to talk a lot.
10k/wav/7985.wav|EN-US|EN| You wanted the evidence.
10k/wav/7988.wav|EN-US|EN| Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
10k/wav/7992.wav|EN-US|EN| The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
10k/wav/8018.wav|EN-US|EN| Equity declined to comment
10k/wav/8024.wav|EN-US|EN| The failings are serious.
10k/wav/8039.wav|EN-US|EN| We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
10k/wav/8045.wav|EN-US|EN| We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
10k/wav/8050.wav|EN-US|EN| They would be supported by visiting specialists.
10k/wav/8056.wav|EN-US|EN| Tear something that you haven't done before.
10k/wav/8084.wav|EN-US|EN| And she doesn't feel like Kaneko's butter.
10k/wav/8087.wav|EN-US|EN| They will be up for it for sure.
10k/wav/8095.wav|EN-US|EN| I was happily surprised.
10k/wav/8104.wav|EN-US|EN| We should be trying to keep him in.
10k/wav/8129.wav|EN-US|EN| I know every village and island on the west coast.
10k/wav/8135.wav|EN-US|EN| She is still very pully.
10k/wav/8148.wav|EN-US|EN| But not a penny has been paid.
10k/wav/8154.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
10k/wav/8167.wav|EN-US|EN| After this the exercise was due to begin.
10k/wav/8175.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a crazy day.
10k/wav/8181.wav|EN-US|EN| Why targets for the Scottish Conservative Party. Aha.
10k/wav/8209.wav|EN-US|EN| She added the sheriff was obviously frustrated.
10k/wav/8212.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
10k/wav/8267.wav|EN-US|EN| I love the spectacle of cinema.
10k/wav/8269.wav|EN-US|EN| The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
10k/wav/8274.wav|EN-US|EN| Policing the profession is important.
10k/wav/828.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a wish list.
10k/wav/8280.wav|EN-US|EN| He is driven.
10k/wav/8286.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither man has been charged.
10k/wav/8309.wav|EN-US|EN| Which is where we come in.
10k/wav/8318.wav|EN-US|EN| All options are on the table.
10k/wav/8324.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the first time I worked with Richard.
10k/wav/8342.wav|EN-US|EN| It is typical of me.
10k/wav/8352.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a historic occasion.
10k/wav/8357.wav|EN-US|EN| If you can get away with it, you do it.
10k/wav/8377.wav|EN-US|EN| I bid in have little to offer.
10k/wav/8406.wav|EN-US|EN| Instead, it's back to the chalkboard.
10k/wav/8423.wav|EN-US|EN| His track record is not promising.
10k/wav/8429.wav|EN-US|EN| The teenager had been missing for six months.
10k/wav/8445.wav|EN-US|EN| I was rubbish.
10k/wav/845.wav|EN-US|EN| Our preference is to play mid-week.
10k/wav/8452.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Macleod said he believed a solution would be reached.
10k/wav/8454.wav|EN-US|EN| It was like a dream to be here.
10k/wav/8458.wav|EN-US|EN| The ass is a diverse and colourful nation.
10k/wav/8473.wav|EN-US|EN| We don't want that at all.
10k/wav/8474.wav|EN-US|EN| The crowd was waiting.
10k/wav/8475.wav|EN-US|EN| Pithar National Treasures
10k/wav/8478.wav|EN-US|EN| My 3s are easy targets.
10k/wav/8481.wav|EN-US|EN| But the government has so far failed to listen.
10k/wav/8512.wav|EN-US|EN| At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
10k/wav/8517.wav|EN-US|EN| We know you will not let us down.
10k/wav/8519.wav|EN-US|EN| I have made good progress.
10k/wav/8526.wav|EN-US|EN| Harry Potter has lost his magic.
10k/wav/8535.wav|EN-US|EN| For a moment it was all about her.
10k/wav/854.wav|EN-US|EN| For once, you should believe the hope.
10k/wav/855.wav|EN-US|EN| He has thatch.
10k/wav/8555.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be released in October.
10k/wav/857.wav|EN-US|EN| No date has been set for meeting.
10k/wav/8587.wav|EN-US|EN| She is a very lucky young lady.
10k/wav/8588.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
10k/wav/8620.wav|EN-US|EN| The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
10k/wav/8628.wav|EN-US|EN| I was always a little behind.
10k/wav/8635.wav|EN-US|EN| All of us in Scotland should be elegant.
10k/wav/8638.wav|EN-US|EN| She asked for the appointment with me.
10k/wav/8640.wav|EN-US|EN| They would want to perform well.
10k/wav/8648.wav|EN-US|EN| Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
10k/wav/8692.wav|EN-US|EN| She thinks we'll cut for us in Brussels.
10k/wav/8696.wav|EN-US|EN| The South African defended his work as a
10k/wav/8738.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no argument with Scotland.
10k/wav/8752.wav|EN-US|EN| That's not part of the deal.
10k/wav/8756.wav|EN-US|EN| We are talking about one family.
10k/wav/8770.wav|EN-US|EN| Investors will also consent about the margin pressure.
10k/wav/8779.wav|EN-US|EN| The tournament has now been cancelled.
10k/wav/8784.wav|EN-US|EN| They had four children together.
10k/wav/879.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all one sided.
10k/wav/8808.wav|EN-US|EN| It is nearly there.
10k/wav/8811.wav|EN-US|EN| which means it matters.
10k/wav/8814.wav|EN-US|EN| The second goal was supup.
10k/wav/8824.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to see it like this.
10k/wav/8838.wav|EN-US|EN| The planning appears to have paid off.
10k/wav/886.wav|EN-US|EN| But would they fall in love?
10k/wav/8883.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think it's vital.
10k/wav/8894.wav|EN-US|EN| The sun is worth a million dollars.
10k/wav/8897.wav|EN-US|EN| They merged before the patients left hospital.
10k/wav/89.wav|EN-US|EN| Despite the result it was still a great moment.
10k/wav/8903.wav|EN-US|EN| We also hope to meet the Australian colonists.
10k/wav/8904.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to expand.
10k/wav/8905.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm now just a bit uneasy.
10k/wav/8938.wav|EN-US|EN| They think that it matters but it doesn't.
10k/wav/895.wav|EN-US|EN| This niece is really depressing.
10k/wav/8977.wav|EN-US|EN| The tail was turned on Wednesday.
10k/wav/8984.wav|EN-US|EN| We go there with confidence.
10k/wav/8987.wav|EN-US|EN| He told the court.
10k/wav/8997.wav|EN-US|EN| Thus far we have received no complaints.
10k/wav/8998.wav|EN-US|EN| I welcome the decision.
10k/wav/9.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't take our chances.
10k/wav/9012.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Cook, left away in the from Brighton, would be ideally replaced.
10k/wav/9016.wav|EN-US|EN| Our traditions and culture remain the same.
10k/wav/9031.wav|EN-US|EN| I have learned a lot from him.
10k/wav/9036.wav|EN-US|EN| She's the runner, she makes the decisions.
10k/wav/9045.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't believe in court.
10k/wav/9050.wav|EN-US|EN| I was delighted with Robbie.
10k/wav/9052.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a fine light to try it.
10k/wav/9069.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm so sorry.
10k/wav/9075.wav|EN-US|EN| For some, it might not make too much difference
10k/wav/9109.wav|EN-US|EN| They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
10k/wav/9123.wav|EN-US|EN| Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
10k/wav/9124.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't an issue.
10k/wav/9130.wav|EN-US|EN| which Scott is likely to emulate his achievements.
10k/wav/9146.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very surprised and obviously delighted.
10k/wav/9148.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a lovely young man.
10k/wav/9150.wav|EN-US|EN| In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
10k/wav/9151.wav|EN-US|EN| He was lying face down in the water.
10k/wav/9165.wav|EN-US|EN| a ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
10k/wav/9167.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a far cry from his election pledges.
10k/wav/9169.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course it is still possible.
10k/wav/9172.wav|EN-US|EN| I am aware that somebody made a threat.
10k/wav/9197.wav|EN-US|EN| He made no order on costs.
10k/wav/9199.wav|EN-US|EN| They were very responsive.
10k/wav/9200.wav|EN-US|EN| I'll never fully fit.
10k/wav/9210.wav|EN-US|EN| On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive
10k/wav/9214.wav|EN-US|EN| We were on top and could have fun.
10k/wav/9220.wav|EN-US|EN| His Christmas is all in the course.
10k/wav/9221.wav|EN-US|EN| I am happy to contribute to that.
10k/wav/9223.wav|EN-US|EN| The discussions will surely not last too long.
10k/wav/9227.wav|EN-US|EN| What's the tour about?
10k/wav/9230.wav|EN-US|EN| They have shown great character.
10k/wav/9264.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the only thing that matters.
10k/wav/9277.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the climax of the thing.
10k/wav/928.wav|EN-US|EN| Wednesday night was a difficult time for Brayton.
10k/wav/9307.wav|EN-US|EN| To date is the first step in that process.
10k/wav/9328.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not show that throat.
10k/wav/935.wav|EN-US|EN| We felt it was sufficient.
10k/wav/9358.wav|EN-US|EN| Two of our crew were killed.
10k/wav/9363.wav|EN-US|EN| Tonight's match is European Championship.
10k/wav/9379.wav|EN-US|EN| There are county managed by in Wilson.
10k/wav/9397.wav|EN-US|EN| As a player you have to move on
10k/wav/9409.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd like to continue that record.
10k/wav/9412.wav|EN-US|EN| They are not suitable.
10k/wav/9414.wav|EN-US|EN| Turning Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland office today.
10k/wav/942.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just so sad
10k/wav/9421.wav|EN-US|EN| We see the rapid reaction force as the way head.
10k/wav/9423.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps the time has come to put the cob in the museum.
10k/wav/9425.wav|EN-US|EN| A decision is expected today.
10k/wav/9434.wav|EN-US|EN| Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
10k/wav/9447.wav|EN-US|EN| An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
10k/wav/9465.wav|EN-US|EN| That is all in the past.
10k/wav/9478.wav|EN-US|EN| But the commission is on a collision course with the government.
10k/wav/9488.wav|EN-US|EN| We did not have a clue.
10k/wav/9489.wav|EN-US|EN| History is usually written by the victors.
10k/wav/9492.wav|EN-US|EN| Anyway, the job will be parked at time.
10k/wav/9499.wav|EN-US|EN| She claimed the day was for young people.
10k/wav/9500.wav|EN-US|EN| Now they have found out the truth.
10k/wav/9502.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be plenty to keep their mocks apart.
10k/wav/9504.wav|EN-US|EN| This he told the committee was not forthcoming.
10k/wav/9514.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to go to the edges.
10k/wav/9518.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot wait for the outdoors.
10k/wav/9520.wav|EN-US|EN| The management team has a hard task ahead.
10k/wav/9536.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, one to two ever refuse.
10k/wav/955.wav|EN-US|EN| There are moments of joy in politics.
10k/wav/9563.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all about money, money, money.
10k/wav/9574.wav|EN-US|EN| A Christian moment has arrived.
10k/wav/9577.wav|EN-US|EN| I just want to injure myself.
10k/wav/9593.wav|EN-US|EN| You let a lot of people down.
10k/wav/9605.wav|EN-US|EN| It's great that it happened in Broton.
10k/wav/9606.wav|EN-US|EN| All would be under threat.
10k/wav/9611.wav|EN-US|EN| This could be one such case, it occurred.
10k/wav/9617.wav|EN-US|EN| Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
10k/wav/9623.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course we knew them from their work in the theatre.
10k/wav/9644.wav|EN-US|EN| Thankfully for me the matter is now closed.
10k/wav/9650.wav|EN-US|EN| Sitter will be back.
10k/wav/9660.wav|EN-US|EN| His options are severely limited.
10k/wav/9665.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not the position of the British relatives.
10k/wav/9667.wav|EN-US|EN| The people will not be patient.
10k/wav/9680.wav|EN-US|EN| I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
10k/wav/9692.wav|EN-US|EN| The health in general is moving on.
10k/wav/9697.wav|EN-US|EN| This would give Scotland round 8 members.
10k/wav/9701.wav|EN-US|EN| However, Y position remains the same.
10k/wav/9707.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't have any answer for them.
10k/wav/9709.wav|EN-US|EN| and so the cycle continues.
10k/wav/9711.wav|EN-US|EN| You cannot blame the turnout.
10k/wav/9759.wav|EN-US|EN| Indeed, he sees the shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
10k/wav/9762.wav|EN-US|EN| He sees the difference in the style of the two teams.
10k/wav/9780.wav|EN-US|EN| Something will be done by corporate bodies.
10k/wav/9782.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a JaiKan.com
10k/wav/9783.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be Kṛṣu.
10k/wav/9788.wav|EN-US|EN| That is absolute nonsense.
10k/wav/9796.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm going to take it further.
10k/wav/9799.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an absolute disgrace.
10k/wav/9818.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a bit like having children.
10k/wav/9835.wav|EN-US|EN| We would have consents about that.
10k/wav/9853.wav|EN-US|EN| It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
10k/wav/9859.wav|EN-US|EN| And she is very clear on this.
10k/wav/9863.wav|EN-US|EN| How can they say that?
10k/wav/988.wav|EN-US|EN| Before the games it was pretty open.
10k/wav/9883.wav|EN-US|EN| There are big names.
10k/wav/9889.wav|EN-US|EN| Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
10k/wav/9898.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't believe you in anything.
10k/wav/99.wav|EN-US|EN| We have spelt the last couple of years with acting directors.
10k/wav/9902.wav|EN-US|EN| It was simply no contest.
10k/wav/9903.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
10k/wav/9908.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a sizeable part of our business.
10k/wav/9910.wav|EN-US|EN| I could never be cool.
10k/wav/9911.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not surprising, but it is appealing.
10k/wav/9913.wav|EN-US|EN| The captaincy will help that too.
10k/wav/9921.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the same with cinema.
10k/wav/9928.wav|EN-US|EN| Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
10k/wav/9936.wav|EN-US|EN| Did he just want to be on tie?
10k/wav/9949.wav|EN-US|EN| That doesn't just happen. You have to build it.
10k/wav/9956.wav|EN-US|EN| Must have been at the bar.
10k/wav/9961.wav|EN-US|EN| Aortitude is exactly the same as before.
10k/wav/9963.wav|EN-US|EN| It would not do any comp to reinforce the message.
10k/wav/9968.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to tell it as it is.
10k/wav/997.wav|EN-US|EN| I just didn't see the point
10k/wav/9979.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
10k/wav/998.wav|EN-US|EN| It is called a killing in the trade.
10k/wav/9985.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't cut any from his face.
10k/wav/9998.wav|EN-US|EN| They are at a very early stage
10k/wav/1.wav|EN-US|EN| These things happen in football but show, didn't they?
10k/wav/1000.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Boris was unimpressed.
10k/wav/1017.wav|EN-US|EN| For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
10k/wav/1019.wav|EN-US|EN| Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just Calabas.
10k/wav/1024.wav|EN-US|EN| The project is far from that.
10k/wav/1044.wav|EN-US|EN| I can't play the game for them.
10k/wav/1049.wav|EN-US|EN| Tinney Plus set as light tool.
10k/wav/107.wav|EN-US|EN| The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
10k/wav/1071.wav|EN-US|EN| And the reason isn't too hot for them.
10k/wav/109.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Masterton said he was very hopeful.
10k/wav/1090.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt really good until Friday.
10k/wav/1098.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not retiring.
10k/wav/11.wav|EN-US|EN| That's a trend which will be encroached.
10k/wav/1109.wav|EN-US|EN| Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
10k/wav/1128.wav|EN-US|EN| The incident is being taken seriously.
10k/wav/1132.wav|EN-US|EN| This is excellent news for Glasgow.
10k/wav/1138.wav|EN-US|EN| The performance was excellent.
10k/wav/1140.wav|EN-US|EN| Since then, physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10k/wav/1159.wav|EN-US|EN| Who would have named?
10k/wav/1182.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him
10k/wav/1192.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't have a problem with getting older.
10k/wav/1204.wav|EN-US|EN| Time has run out for Sodom the Zane.
10k/wav/1205.wav|EN-US|EN| The key issue for us is public safety.
10k/wav/1208.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be dangerous to resign.
10k/wav/1209.wav|EN-US|EN| The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
10k/wav/1215.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that not uncanny?
10k/wav/1248.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't about her singing though.
10k/wav/126.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
10k/wav/127.wav|EN-US|EN| We are the gateway to justice.
10k/wav/1271.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been let down by these people.
10k/wav/1274.wav|EN-US|EN| But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
10k/wav/128.wav|EN-US|EN| We have expanded too quickly.
10k/wav/1306.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the bottom line.
10k/wav/1315.wav|EN-US|EN| That's where it all started.
10k/wav/1320.wav|EN-US|EN| I really didn't think he would.
10k/wav/1323.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all changed on the music scene in Manchester.
10k/wav/1373.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a killer piece.
10k/wav/1376.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't expect to see that this time.
10k/wav/138.wav|EN-US|EN| But mainly it is up to ourselves.
10k/wav/1409.wav|EN-US|EN| It appears to have been closed down
10k/wav/1421.wav|EN-US|EN| We said it needed enough to win it, but didn't do.
10k/wav/1423.wav|EN-US|EN| Though it's not much money in cycling.
10k/wav/1453.wav|EN-US|EN| People liking Kivrok be a good name.
10k/wav/1458.wav|EN-US|EN| The atmosphere in the dressing room is the pub.
10k/wav/1469.wav|EN-US|EN| But I have been told that Rockbe playing numbers are a picket.
10k/wav/1487.wav|EN-US|EN| They were certainly tough, but totally foul
10k/wav/1492.wav|EN-US|EN| We wish to win, but not at any price.
10k/wav/1511.wav|EN-US|EN| They come to enjoy themselves.
10k/wav/1512.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got no money to go anywhere.
10k/wav/1540.wav|EN-US|EN| Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes
10k/wav/1554.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a commission and for its work nears work.
10k/wav/159.wav|EN-US|EN| This will secure the future of our industry.
10k/wav/1595.wav|EN-US|EN| On the month the weakness was across the board.
10k/wav/16.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a Campbell.
10k/wav/1616.wav|EN-US|EN| But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
10k/wav/162.wav|EN-US|EN| Who was on the panel?
10k/wav/1642.wav|EN-US|EN| History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
10k/wav/1647.wav|EN-US|EN| But Anico's just amazing.
10k/wav/1650.wav|EN-US|EN| Someone else has not got them.
10k/wav/1651.wav|EN-US|EN| A fence to the hut was not easily overlooked.
10k/wav/1675.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been handled entirely properly.
10k/wav/1677.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to look towards next season.
10k/wav/1691.wav|EN-US|EN| Other teams moved up too.
10k/wav/1696.wav|EN-US|EN| We shade a lot of skill in the final quarter.
10k/wav/1704.wav|EN-US|EN| She has reached the top of her profession.
10k/wav/1709.wav|EN-US|EN| But it took a lot of bottle.
10k/wav/171.wav|EN-US|EN| Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10k/wav/1711.wav|EN-US|EN| The science is running. The solution is simple.
10k/wav/1715.wav|EN-US|EN| New Zealand Drogby is totally different.
10k/wav/1719.wav|EN-US|EN| I just felt like a tad loss.
10k/wav/172.wav|EN-US|EN| This looks like it's anything but open.
10k/wav/1722.wav|EN-US|EN| I am looking for work in Bart and back home in Scotland.
10k/wav/1724.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the first stage of catching up.
10k/wav/1728.wav|EN-US|EN| You will get something like a house on fire.
10k/wav/1729.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a drain country.
10k/wav/173.wav|EN-US|EN| It is also well received.
10k/wav/1737.wav|EN-US|EN| It's time for a change
10k/wav/176.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not interested in selling him.
10k/wav/1768.wav|EN-US|EN| Most people know that.
10k/wav/1771.wav|EN-US|EN| Why was their passion the power and feeling?
10k/wav/1781.wav|EN-US|EN| The effects are not all bad.
10k/wav/1784.wav|EN-US|EN| It is simple really.
10k/wav/1798.wav|EN-US|EN| Other musicians were found in retirement.
10k/wav/1799.wav|EN-US|EN| He was shocked by what he saw.
10k/wav/1803.wav|EN-US|EN| We have never been shorter volunteers.
10k/wav/1805.wav|EN-US|EN| They say they feel different.
10k/wav/1822.wav|EN-US|EN| They might have asked for goodness sake.
10k/wav/1827.wav|EN-US|EN| The next thing will be cutting journey times.
10k/wav/1828.wav|EN-US|EN| He was a national treasure.
10k/wav/1841.wav|EN-US|EN| No money for students would help in an ideal world.
10k/wav/1855.wav|EN-US|EN| How do we get more people in?
10k/wav/1862.wav|EN-US|EN| For businesses the benefits will be enormous.
10k/wav/1885.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a massive error of judgement.
10k/wav/1886.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't decide to be sent off.
10k/wav/19.wav|EN-US|EN| It was great fun!
10k/wav/190.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not very clear that doesn't work.
10k/wav/1912.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd never held him in person before.
10k/wav/1917.wav|EN-US|EN| We are well in shirt.
10k/wav/1920.wav|EN-US|EN| He has real potential.
10k/wav/1933.wav|EN-US|EN| Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
10k/wav/1966.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you want a cup of tea?
10k/wav/1972.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he was delighted by the wort.
10k/wav/1980.wav|EN-US|EN| No one was listening.
10k/wav/1993.wav|EN-US|EN| The feeling is hard to describe.
10k/wav/1999.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it is a great idea.
10k/wav/2003.wav|EN-US|EN| The only problem was, they were all in self.
10k/wav/2004.wav|EN-US|EN| Can they be serious?
10k/wav/2021.wav|EN-US|EN| It had been introduced over six years.
10k/wav/2027.wav|EN-US|EN| It makes for an interesting conference.
10k/wav/2031.wav|EN-US|EN| An announcement is expected today on their future.
10k/wav/2034.wav|EN-US|EN| The Cartriver Diet
10k/wav/205.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm ashamed of them.
10k/wav/2054.wav|EN-US|EN| We have no knowledge of this.
10k/wav/2059.wav|EN-US|EN| Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
10k/wav/206.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the way they are.
10k/wav/2060.wav|EN-US|EN| They receive a high profile in the media.
10k/wav/2074.wav|EN-US|EN| I was delighted with every one of them.
10k/wav/2075.wav|EN-US|EN| Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
10k/wav/2081.wav|EN-US|EN| She is the pup.
10k/wav/2082.wav|EN-US|EN| There's always a solution somewhere you can meet in the middle.
10k/wav/2086.wav|EN-US|EN| The plot is minimal.
10k/wav/2087.wav|EN-US|EN| It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
10k/wav/2090.wav|EN-US|EN| Hart stood back with two goals in four minutes.
10k/wav/210.wav|EN-US|EN| This is our Olympics.
10k/wav/2103.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been at the Evening Standard for two years.
10k/wav/2111.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the proposal is not aimed at Rockby, but at all supports.
10k/wav/2114.wav|EN-US|EN| She brought a lot to Marth.
10k/wav/213.wav|EN-US|EN| We lost a play.
10k/wav/2131.wav|EN-US|EN| Check the tees dot
10k/wav/2133.wav|EN-US|EN| Dunfermooton decides to go for the hot walk.
10k/wav/2176.wav|EN-US|EN| The festival idea has been a great success.
10k/wav/2177.wav|EN-US|EN| Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
10k/wav/2180.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm the Hat.
10k/wav/2183.wav|EN-US|EN| The former is called an idiot.
10k/wav/2193.wav|EN-US|EN| I probably would have been a dancer.
10k/wav/22.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a natural reaction.
10k/wav/221.wav|EN-US|EN| On Friday, the headager and deputy headager appeared at the door.
10k/wav/2219.wav|EN-US|EN| We're not that bad.
10k/wav/2220.wav|EN-US|EN| There would appear to be no motor for the tach
10k/wav/2221.wav|EN-US|EN| Ward Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
10k/wav/2231.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's there to be one.
10k/wav/2236.wav|EN-US|EN| He had reason to be pleased.
10k/wav/2237.wav|EN-US|EN| This year it was a little different.
10k/wav/2251.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very encouraged by this pool.
10k/wav/2254.wav|EN-US|EN| Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
10k/wav/2270.wav|EN-US|EN| He was part of South Africa.
10k/wav/2281.wav|EN-US|EN| They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
10k/wav/2292.wav|EN-US|EN| Not in this production. He doesn't.
10k/wav/2293.wav|EN-US|EN| I got in with a bat crowd.
10k/wav/2295.wav|EN-US|EN| The outcome is not in doubt.
10k/wav/2299.wav|EN-US|EN| He's the great dealer.
10k/wav/2308.wav|EN-US|EN| Her death is a huge blow.
10k/wav/2320.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows that painting is still relevant.
10k/wav/2325.wav|EN-US|EN| This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
10k/wav/2334.wav|EN-US|EN| Work is underway to create a studio in Inverness.
10k/wav/2337.wav|EN-US|EN| What a synonym is this, the age of the internet.
10k/wav/2361.wav|EN-US|EN| He had never run the distance before.
10k/wav/2362.wav|EN-US|EN| It needs to be volatile.
10k/wav/2367.wav|EN-US|EN| I have decided to quit the show.
10k/wav/2369.wav|EN-US|EN| In the end, it was no choice.
10k/wav/2372.wav|EN-US|EN| The hill process is a vicious circle at the moment.
10k/wav/2377.wav|EN-US|EN| Saturday's match was only straightforward.
10k/wav/2396.wav|EN-US|EN| The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
10k/wav/2416.wav|EN-US|EN| Luckily for us he enjoyed the experience.
10k/wav/2427.wav|EN-US|EN| I enjoyed this summer, which is a big difference from last year.
10k/wav/243.wav|EN-US|EN| They are a very powerful and tasty sight.
10k/wav/2431.wav|EN-US|EN| The crucial strike was that to come
10k/wav/245.wav|EN-US|EN| Immediate action must be taken.
10k/wav/2457.wav|EN-US|EN| Don't you believe it?
10k/wav/2481.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot wait for the season to end.
10k/wav/2488.wav|EN-US|EN| The comments is too updated.
10k/wav/2490.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you think of the hair?
10k/wav/2496.wav|EN-US|EN| When it comes down to it, this is a job.
10k/wav/2498.wav|EN-US|EN| He supported the decision to review the decision.
10k/wav/2500.wav|EN-US|EN| This is still not good enough.
10k/wav/2505.wav|EN-US|EN| I learned a lot from that
10k/wav/2507.wav|EN-US|EN| We've just decided to do something about it.
10k/wav/2508.wav|EN-US|EN| He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
10k/wav/251.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all in the mind.
10k/wav/2530.wav|EN-US|EN| Selection is not in my hands at all.
10k/wav/2544.wav|EN-US|EN| Then everyone must consider their future.
10k/wav/256.wav|EN-US|EN| How do you take them away?
10k/wav/2567.wav|EN-US|EN| And we still have to pay sorry.
10k/wav/2603.wav|EN-US|EN| Nevesha Denny statement after the hearing.
10k/wav/2611.wav|EN-US|EN| Mine of the tourists were killed instantly.
10k/wav/2633.wav|EN-US|EN| You are not allowed to do that.
10k/wav/2640.wav|EN-US|EN| For business, the benefits will be enormous.
10k/wav/2651.wav|EN-US|EN| We've been overwhelmed by the response.
10k/wav/2656.wav|EN-US|EN| None of this work is guaranteed.
10k/wav/2658.wav|EN-US|EN| It is no place for a pout.
10k/wav/2704.wav|EN-US|EN| Miss Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
10k/wav/2712.wav|EN-US|EN| They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
10k/wav/2728.wav|EN-US|EN| We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
10k/wav/2729.wav|EN-US|EN| It is misleading to compound the two.
10k/wav/2769.wav|EN-US|EN| A decision is expected tomorrow.
10k/wav/2789.wav|EN-US|EN| Italy is a beautiful place.
10k/wav/2794.wav|EN-US|EN| There is still a long way to go
10k/wav/2807.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, they should have scored three times.
10k/wav/2811.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time for a more honest approach.
10k/wav/2825.wav|EN-US|EN| First choice is the Clonido in Toms of Performance.
10k/wav/2829.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
10k/wav/2833.wav|EN-US|EN| Aspect's men refused to confirm the figure.
10k/wav/2834.wav|EN-US|EN| The major championships will always have a special place.
10k/wav/2843.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact it was almost as if it was expected.
10k/wav/2846.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very happy.
10k/wav/2848.wav|EN-US|EN| They still have a great sense of humor.
10k/wav/2863.wav|EN-US|EN| This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
10k/wav/2874.wav|EN-US|EN| Four immense was evenly divided on the issue.
10k/wav/2882.wav|EN-US|EN| The impact was immediate.
10k/wav/2883.wav|EN-US|EN| But a solution has been found.
10k/wav/2886.wav|EN-US|EN| You look like a rugby player.
10k/wav/2892.wav|EN-US|EN| However, she did not report the murder to the police
10k/wav/2900.wav|EN-US|EN| Revival is underway.
10k/wav/2907.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not obsessed with sex.
10k/wav/2914.wav|EN-US|EN| The auto senator metro was announced by the foreign office.
10k/wav/2924.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a step forward.
10k/wav/2932.wav|EN-US|EN| It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was favour grateful.
10k/wav/2940.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a lot of hard work, but it was inter-difficult.
10k/wav/2948.wav|EN-US|EN| face to face
10k/wav/2955.wav|EN-US|EN| I had to come back from London.
10k/wav/2961.wav|EN-US|EN| The banking sector was weak.
10k/wav/2962.wav|EN-US|EN| At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
10k/wav/2968.wav|EN-US|EN| Then those are the problem of sympathy.
10k/wav/2970.wav|EN-US|EN| The price paid for it was not disclosed.
10k/wav/2991.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a blessing.
10k/wav/3005.wav|EN-US|EN| It was better than a soap opera.
10k/wav/3037.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
10k/wav/3042.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a high time tact.
10k/wav/3068.wav|EN-US|EN| Inuit water is going to your lot.
10k/wav/307.wav|EN-US|EN| Woe plays down return
10k/wav/3076.wav|EN-US|EN| They really shouldn't have put it out.
10k/wav/3085.wav|EN-US|EN| It was for me, like a week in heaven.
10k/wav/3086.wav|EN-US|EN| They are include spurts.
10k/wav/3098.wav|EN-US|EN| Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
10k/wav/31.wav|EN-US|EN| This decision is folly.
10k/wav/3106.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not a finale he would want to remember.
10k/wav/3108.wav|EN-US|EN| It is no longer the White Death.
10k/wav/3115.wav|EN-US|EN| She is a valuable member of the government.
10k/wav/3118.wav|EN-US|EN| This strong performance is expected to continue.
10k/wav/312.wav|EN-US|EN| This was no accident.
10k/wav/3137.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, we will need to strengthen the squat fully open.
10k/wav/3144.wav|EN-US|EN| We have it on video.
10k/wav/3168.wav|EN-US|EN| He wants the festival to make a difference.
10k/wav/3181.wav|EN-US|EN| Shim always, Justice Minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
10k/wav/3187.wav|EN-US|EN| Eyefitness was very poor.
10k/wav/3192.wav|EN-US|EN| And there is another problem.
10k/wav/320.wav|EN-US|EN| He was elected as a council last year.
10k/wav/3212.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not understood by people outside.
10k/wav/3217.wav|EN-US|EN| He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
10k/wav/3228.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not of course a concert hall.
10k/wav/3238.wav|EN-US|EN| Our job is to change that.
10k/wav/3239.wav|EN-US|EN| Not that it was needed.
10k/wav/3248.wav|EN-US|EN| First Minister Donald too will respond.
10k/wav/328.wav|EN-US|EN| The newspapers, by contrast, had Helmbow Valley.
10k/wav/3294.wav|EN-US|EN| Several people were out in the street.
10k/wav/3304.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing is real doubt.
10k/wav/3323.wav|EN-US|EN| This operation will change our life.
10k/wav/3337.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a completely new experience for me.
10k/wav/3340.wav|EN-US|EN| Then in came a succession of signings
10k/wav/3342.wav|EN-US|EN| I have worked as a stand-up there often
10k/wav/3354.wav|EN-US|EN| I certainly believe we can do it.
10k/wav/3375.wav|EN-US|EN| The penalty was the turning point.
10k/wav/338.wav|EN-US|EN| Ward Levy said he started life with nothing.
10k/wav/3399.wav|EN-US|EN| He had a really frustrating time last year.
10k/wav/3416.wav|EN-US|EN| We are at a crossroads.
10k/wav/3425.wav|EN-US|EN| I could not live with it.
10k/wav/3434.wav|EN-US|EN| I was just trying to win the goth tournament.
10k/wav/3435.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing has been decided yet.
10k/wav/3451.wav|EN-US|EN| This is far too high.
10k/wav/3455.wav|EN-US|EN| They will be ready.
10k/wav/3461.wav|EN-US|EN| Many others are subjected to violence by men.
10k/wav/3465.wav|EN-US|EN| They haven't got a hope.
10k/wav/3467.wav|EN-US|EN| It was actually very very difficult.
10k/wav/3484.wav|EN-US|EN| Not if you know the person.
10k/wav/3485.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very interesting subject.
10k/wav/3493.wav|EN-US|EN| Every screw in Scotland should be excellent.
10k/wav/3495.wav|EN-US|EN| Last week he was taken into hospital.
10k/wav/3500.wav|EN-US|EN| That's what we are still trying to do.
10k/wav/3503.wav|EN-US|EN| It was like a vacuum.
10k/wav/3504.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the real test.
10k/wav/3533.wav|EN-US|EN| He is not the only one.
10k/wav/3555.wav|EN-US|EN| Colvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
10k/wav/3558.wav|EN-US|EN| This gives us a lot of practice.
10k/wav/356.wav|EN-US|EN| It is quite simple.
10k/wav/3567.wav|EN-US|EN| I've even got mine ideas.
10k/wav/357.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a scandal.
10k/wav/358.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the most annoying thing.
10k/wav/3592.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the Anne Scott and with all supporters.
10k/wav/3599.wav|EN-US|EN| This was not a contest.
10k/wav/3620.wav|EN-US|EN| Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
10k/wav/3626.wav|EN-US|EN| There remains an outstanding temperature section against the former.
10k/wav/3632.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
10k/wav/367.wav|EN-US|EN| She had gone to the Catholic school.
10k/wav/3676.wav|EN-US|EN| Seven people were critically injured.
10k/wav/368.wav|EN-US|EN| Why was their passion, the power, the feeling?
10k/wav/3680.wav|EN-US|EN| Her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
10k/wav/3689.wav|EN-US|EN| That was very important.
10k/wav/3702.wav|EN-US|EN| There are simply no orders.
10k/wav/3715.wav|EN-US|EN| However, everyone should do it right in their life.
10k/wav/3717.wav|EN-US|EN| Barry Ferguson is one of them.
10k/wav/3722.wav|EN-US|EN| I can't even get into the team.
10k/wav/3731.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe that was the hell point.
10k/wav/3732.wav|EN-US|EN| We cannot go on in this fashion.
10k/wav/3743.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a narrow escape.
10k/wav/3755.wav|EN-US|EN| We called in it to believe it, at first.
10k/wav/3779.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very concerned about control and fatigue.
10k/wav/3785.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly there was a mix-up.
10k/wav/3786.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be kept informed.
10k/wav/3788.wav|EN-US|EN| Actors like to be in the centre.
10k/wav/3807.wav|EN-US|EN| No pisribleness.
10k/wav/3809.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel very grateful with everything.
10k/wav/3814.wav|EN-US|EN| That's it and you brought me back down to earth.
10k/wav/3815.wav|EN-US|EN| She has gone to the Catholic school.
10k/wav/3829.wav|EN-US|EN| We certainly hope we have been successful.
10k/wav/383.wav|EN-US|EN| There are you, the fans.
10k/wav/3831.wav|EN-US|EN| There could still be some to come forward.
10k/wav/3833.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem is not confined to deck.
10k/wav/3834.wav|EN-US|EN| Does it work? Is it safe and is it right?
10k/wav/3869.wav|EN-US|EN| The truth is, he probably doesn't do.
10k/wav/3879.wav|EN-US|EN| She had projects for their needs.
10k/wav/3885.wav|EN-US|EN| No production was achieved.
10k/wav/3894.wav|EN-US|EN| I played really well on the backline.
10k/wav/3905.wav|EN-US|EN| Seven people were later detained by police.
10k/wav/3906.wav|EN-US|EN| We had to work out for it.
10k/wav/3922.wav|EN-US|EN| Genetic assessment is crucial.
10k/wav/3931.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there is great potential in this rite.
10k/wav/3942.wav|EN-US|EN| This was done by the council staff.
10k/wav/3943.wav|EN-US|EN| Upsenses should be carefully monitored.
10k/wav/3950.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything is surrounded by confusion.
10k/wav/4002.wav|EN-US|EN| I want him to take on Gomez.
10k/wav/4003.wav|EN-US|EN| It also has a good labour supply.
10k/wav/4017.wav|EN-US|EN| I need a publishing deal.
10k/wav/4023.wav|EN-US|EN| He may have a punt.
10k/wav/4024.wav|EN-US|EN| He tried to stop it but it was already too late.
10k/wav/4029.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a blunt instrument anyway.
10k/wav/405.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a good friend.
10k/wav/4051.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure they will be very happy.
10k/wav/4055.wav|EN-US|EN| She has a little bow.
10k/wav/4056.wav|EN-US|EN| They had had time for little hours.
10k/wav/4068.wav|EN-US|EN| How are you, sir?
10k/wav/4077.wav|EN-US|EN| It is too pretty, it is too small
10k/wav/4095.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it's the disgrace.
10k/wav/4116.wav|EN-US|EN| I would recommend it.
10k/wav/4125.wav|EN-US|EN| Vicious are very intense
10k/wav/4129.wav|EN-US|EN| He says the nature of this Parliament in a simple realistic context.
10k/wav/4135.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm expecting to win.
10k/wav/415.wav|EN-US|EN| Film music was never the same again.
10k/wav/4156.wav|EN-US|EN| They did not attack the themes of the book.
10k/wav/4176.wav|EN-US|EN| He would be with his purse.
10k/wav/4184.wav|EN-US|EN| They are interior designers and Docsics.
10k/wav/4198.wav|EN-US|EN| He came in an army uniform.
10k/wav/4209.wav|EN-US|EN| The company is in good shape.
10k/wav/4217.wav|EN-US|EN| The uptime in the housing market has given a big boost.
10k/wav/4222.wav|EN-US|EN| However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
10k/wav/4227.wav|EN-US|EN| Not that Bob has been unhappy.
10k/wav/4235.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not being marketed properly.
10k/wav/4238.wav|EN-US|EN| It is almost certain to be the last.
10k/wav/4249.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been a tough year for Scottish business.
10k/wav/4253.wav|EN-US|EN| A lot of things can go wrong.
10k/wav/4262.wav|EN-US|EN| Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
10k/wav/4265.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a good cane to watch.
10k/wav/4285.wav|EN-US|EN| That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
10k/wav/4286.wav|EN-US|EN| I would love to see it back there.
10k/wav/43.wav|EN-US|EN| Repayment is not part of the game.
10k/wav/4307.wav|EN-US|EN| The festivals will be about having fun.
10k/wav/4310.wav|EN-US|EN| There's nothing I can say.
10k/wav/4313.wav|EN-US|EN| We will listen to colleagues.
10k/wav/4326.wav|EN-US|EN| Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
10k/wav/4336.wav|EN-US|EN| They want to be entertained.
10k/wav/4338.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not an optional extra.
10k/wav/4343.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a joke.
10k/wav/4344.wav|EN-US|EN| The atmosphere is business like.
10k/wav/4363.wav|EN-US|EN| Mecony is struggling against terrible marker forces.
10k/wav/4383.wav|EN-US|EN| I have to keep working hard.
10k/wav/4398.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the matter for them.
10k/wav/4409.wav|EN-US|EN| The consensus is it's worth it.
10k/wav/4418.wav|EN-US|EN| It's important to get it right.
10k/wav/4421.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone was very saddened.
10k/wav/4427.wav|EN-US|EN| They had asked not to be named.
10k/wav/4436.wav|EN-US|EN| The referee didn't do the stop.
10k/wav/4456.wav|EN-US|EN| Autukash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
10k/wav/4477.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem is the book.
10k/wav/4481.wav|EN-US|EN| I was left-handed but it was just a matter of practice.
10k/wav/4486.wav|EN-US|EN| The children are being very brave.
10k/wav/4500.wav|EN-US|EN| It is planned for London in the spring.
10k/wav/4506.wav|EN-US|EN| The game will be at a football stadium.
10k/wav/4527.wav|EN-US|EN| The management agreement, however, was conceded.
10k/wav/4529.wav|EN-US|EN| and well you might
10k/wav/4530.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
10k/wav/4553.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm still waiting for her.
10k/wav/4556.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very nice.
10k/wav/4561.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't a good day for us.
10k/wav/4568.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not, however, a general election reshuffle.
10k/wav/4569.wav|EN-US|EN| Last year's winner was Saji Agossu.
10k/wav/4577.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish the solutions was easy.
10k/wav/4585.wav|EN-US|EN| We must improve our relations with the government.
10k/wav/4588.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
10k/wav/4593.wav|EN-US|EN| All options are available.
10k/wav/4606.wav|EN-US|EN| The world record is suspicious.
10k/wav/4607.wav|EN-US|EN| He replied that it was a dilemma.
10k/wav/4608.wav|EN-US|EN| He had a great game.
10k/wav/461.wav|EN-US|EN| That in itself is a neurotic experience.
10k/wav/4618.wav|EN-US|EN| That is very important.
10k/wav/4632.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a touch of class.
10k/wav/4633.wav|EN-US|EN| She died in hospital two hours later.
10k/wav/4635.wav|EN-US|EN| Do it for Ocelot.
10k/wav/4641.wav|EN-US|EN| Overall, however, these rules are down.
10k/wav/4649.wav|EN-US|EN| That must be left to the pro board.
10k/wav/4651.wav|EN-US|EN| We have great support.
10k/wav/4658.wav|EN-US|EN| We have the easy part.
10k/wav/4664.wav|EN-US|EN| It is far too early
10k/wav/4672.wav|EN-US|EN| There was nothing sinister in that.
10k/wav/4686.wav|EN-US|EN| When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
10k/wav/4705.wav|EN-US|EN| and he ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
10k/wav/4716.wav|EN-US|EN| Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
10k/wav/4720.wav|EN-US|EN| Former Hamilton defender Colleen Miller could return to the club today's manager.
10k/wav/4726.wav|EN-US|EN| The big problem is the lack of grass.
10k/wav/4759.wav|EN-US|EN| Not so, it seems.
10k/wav/4766.wav|EN-US|EN| They said they would.
10k/wav/4773.wav|EN-US|EN| intensive care has been very busy
10k/wav/478.wav|EN-US|EN| He met his wife and married in England.
10k/wav/4785.wav|EN-US|EN| These surfaces may also have to be cut.
10k/wav/4793.wav|EN-US|EN| Instead, it is back to the trauma port.
10k/wav/4798.wav|EN-US|EN| National Film Institute in Scotland President Tim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
10k/wav/4799.wav|EN-US|EN| He has done that with a great deal to spare.
10k/wav/480.wav|EN-US|EN| Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
10k/wav/4803.wav|EN-US|EN| They made a huge impression on me.
10k/wav/4818.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like an extension of your body.
10k/wav/4828.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a daunting task.
10k/wav/4840.wav|EN-US|EN| It was quite a new prescription.
10k/wav/4849.wav|EN-US|EN| Instead, she just went away.
10k/wav/4852.wav|EN-US|EN| He's a star.
10k/wav/4854.wav|EN-US|EN| If the red of the second bar falls upon the green of the fast, the result is to give a bar with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light were mixed form yellow.
10k/wav/4856.wav|EN-US|EN| But he can turn on the job.
10k/wav/4871.wav|EN-US|EN| He said that this is beautiful.
10k/wav/4873.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't have many friends.
10k/wav/4893.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not an employment agency.
10k/wav/4898.wav|EN-US|EN| One is too many.
10k/wav/4911.wav|EN-US|EN| It might change your life.
10k/wav/4916.wav|EN-US|EN| He was child for five years.
10k/wav/4918.wav|EN-US|EN| That was internet stunting performance from Celtic.
10k/wav/4926.wav|EN-US|EN| But there are some problems.
10k/wav/4938.wav|EN-US|EN| We were clays but not clays enough.
10k/wav/4939.wav|EN-US|EN| But who will buy it?
10k/wav/4947.wav|EN-US|EN| He would help me with the form.
10k/wav/4952.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to win every game.
10k/wav/4958.wav|EN-US|EN| They pointed to the site.
10k/wav/4959.wav|EN-US|EN| They can leave at any time
10k/wav/4971.wav|EN-US|EN| But by that time, of course, it is again.
10k/wav/4978.wav|EN-US|EN| I would have been shot dead in bed.
10k/wav/4979.wav|EN-US|EN| I fell to the ground.
10k/wav/4988.wav|EN-US|EN| And that's the question for the chamber.
10k/wav/4993.wav|EN-US|EN| He said nothing to waiting journalists.
10k/wav/500.wav|EN-US|EN| They were going through the missions but that's about all.
10k/wav/5005.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not fair.
10k/wav/5007.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, he is very much a Kilmarnock man.
10k/wav/5028.wav|EN-US|EN| The film is about the cost of genius.
10k/wav/5042.wav|EN-US|EN| He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
10k/wav/5053.wav|EN-US|EN| Pig farmers are completely despondent.
10k/wav/506.wav|EN-US|EN| Does that put pressure on us?
10k/wav/5069.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a case of taking a risk.
10k/wav/5077.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
10k/wav/508.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an interesting thing to do.
10k/wav/5080.wav|EN-US|EN| He certainly did a good job.
10k/wav/5081.wav|EN-US|EN| Last weekend he was awful.
10k/wav/5103.wav|EN-US|EN| It plans to return to this field.
10k/wav/5106.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the same with us.
10k/wav/5126.wav|EN-US|EN| It sounds a lot of money.
10k/wav/5129.wav|EN-US|EN| She would say he was still the best.
10k/wav/5136.wav|EN-US|EN| No unpassant or small group could be synchialed it.
10k/wav/5137.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been supremely successful.
10k/wav/5146.wav|EN-US|EN| A home office spokesman said
10k/wav/5148.wav|EN-US|EN| We should not be complacent.
10k/wav/5168.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to be patient.
10k/wav/5169.wav|EN-US|EN| We've all been here before.
10k/wav/5184.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not just for classical music.
10k/wav/5192.wav|EN-US|EN| Any hour of judgement was real doubt.
10k/wav/5194.wav|EN-US|EN| The confidence isn't down now.
10k/wav/5199.wav|EN-US|EN| It was pretty special.
10k/wav/5202.wav|EN-US|EN| She said she could not believe that they had run away.
10k/wav/5218.wav|EN-US|EN| The scheme is hopelessly failing.
10k/wav/5228.wav|EN-US|EN| The actors just have to say so.
10k/wav/5245.wav|EN-US|EN| Officials say the city must achieve this.
10k/wav/5246.wav|EN-US|EN| That depends on ranges.
10k/wav/5264.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the last straw.
10k/wav/5269.wav|EN-US|EN| The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a superimposition of the number of bows.
10k/wav/5278.wav|EN-US|EN| And here is the RUP.
10k/wav/5282.wav|EN-US|EN| Anyone can do the stunts.
10k/wav/5289.wav|EN-US|EN| They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
10k/wav/5298.wav|EN-US|EN| He became the focus of sound and empress.
10k/wav/5307.wav|EN-US|EN| Are his wax inside out?
10k/wav/5309.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just looking to take my chances.
10k/wav/5327.wav|EN-US|EN| football is a passion for many
10k/wav/5328.wav|EN-US|EN| The court has not decided.
10k/wav/533.wav|EN-US|EN| This was the classical period of Beethoven.
10k/wav/5337.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very big problem.
10k/wav/5347.wav|EN-US|EN| The package of measures and extra cash are a major step forward.
10k/wav/5348.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not even finished.
10k/wav/5350.wav|EN-US|EN| Lane Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
10k/wav/5358.wav|EN-US|EN| So it was at Easter rate.
10k/wav/5371.wav|EN-US|EN| His name was unknown.
10k/wav/538.wav|EN-US|EN| The tribunal continues today.
10k/wav/5384.wav|EN-US|EN| Many farmers can not even agree with their own families.
10k/wav/5385.wav|EN-US|EN| They were due to have begun today.
10k/wav/5390.wav|EN-US|EN| That will be a problem for later.
10k/wav/5406.wav|EN-US|EN| But is this enough to prove it could kill him?
10k/wav/5415.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows a great deal to come back onto that mental pressure.
10k/wav/543.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be a new experience.
10k/wav/5433.wav|EN-US|EN| He saw serious matches.
10k/wav/5434.wav|EN-US|EN| And frankly, it's been a while.
10k/wav/5438.wav|EN-US|EN| It was his job to check.
10k/wav/5441.wav|EN-US|EN| Shaltu also supports the reform.
10k/wav/5451.wav|EN-US|EN| Other peoples are tried.
10k/wav/5477.wav|EN-US|EN| He is close friend of Corden Brown.
10k/wav/5498.wav|EN-US|EN| He was at school in Devon.
10k/wav/5522.wav|EN-US|EN| I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
10k/wav/5526.wav|EN-US|EN| The parties have no contact.
10k/wav/5544.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got a good management report.
10k/wav/5559.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to be epic.
10k/wav/5563.wav|EN-US|EN| He has one son and one daughter.
10k/wav/5592.wav|EN-US|EN| That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
10k/wav/5605.wav|EN-US|EN| The meat was defined
10k/wav/5607.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time for a new approach.
10k/wav/562.wav|EN-US|EN| He talks too much.
10k/wav/5621.wav|EN-US|EN| I was just aghast.
10k/wav/5629.wav|EN-US|EN| This is great news.
10k/wav/5654.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not been in touch with the club.
10k/wav/566.wav|EN-US|EN| So I'm going in the right direction
10k/wav/5660.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the case with David.
10k/wav/5669.wav|EN-US|EN| But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
10k/wav/5678.wav|EN-US|EN| In each case there were a goal down.
10k/wav/568.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing can bring back their son.
10k/wav/5702.wav|EN-US|EN| It also makes for interesting viewing.
10k/wav/5714.wav|EN-US|EN| You guys better look patting on a face for the world.
10k/wav/5727.wav|EN-US|EN| You could see he was thinking about it.
10k/wav/5734.wav|EN-US|EN| Thank you very much and see you next time.
10k/wav/5735.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone was writing me off.
10k/wav/574.wav|EN-US|EN| The casting of her husband was an accident.
10k/wav/5747.wav|EN-US|EN| They say he wants to go to England.
10k/wav/577.wav|EN-US|EN| Why does she suddenly win everything there?
10k/wav/5776.wav|EN-US|EN| It will not be today, though.
10k/wav/580.wav|EN-US|EN| I was close enough.
10k/wav/5801.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lack of chemistry.
10k/wav/5802.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the French government has a major dilemma on its centres
10k/wav/5805.wav|EN-US|EN| That's nothing in that argument.
10k/wav/5808.wav|EN-US|EN| A similar scheme is underway in central Scotland.
10k/wav/5811.wav|EN-US|EN| On this occasion, the case for public inquiry was not made.
10k/wav/5814.wav|EN-US|EN| There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
10k/wav/5826.wav|EN-US|EN| This means a great deal to the families.
10k/wav/5831.wav|EN-US|EN| Things have just worked out this way.
10k/wav/5834.wav|EN-US|EN| It has this speed off the mark but is so impressive.
10k/wav/5842.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the crosswinds.
10k/wav/5845.wav|EN-US|EN| The allocations were still under investigation, he added.
10k/wav/585.wav|EN-US|EN| That's a big reduction.
10k/wav/5867.wav|EN-US|EN| The move has perfected mixed response.
10k/wav/5877.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a major step forward for the cars.
10k/wav/5894.wav|EN-US|EN| Partful, but only because it's true.
10k/wav/5908.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a seat changing approach.
10k/wav/5913.wav|EN-US|EN| The case was continued.
10k/wav/5930.wav|EN-US|EN| He later told the Herald it is true.
10k/wav/5940.wav|EN-US|EN| It will not be easy.
10k/wav/5941.wav|EN-US|EN| I said what does this mean?
10k/wav/5945.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the technical demand.
10k/wav/5949.wav|EN-US|EN| We have great teams but...
10k/wav/5994.wav|EN-US|EN| People have no chance of getting that.
10k/wav/5998.wav|EN-US|EN| It's show team the way to drive.
10k/wav/5999.wav|EN-US|EN| It's really good fun.
10k/wav/60.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be back next year.
10k/wav/6007.wav|EN-US|EN| I accept that, but it's very upsetting.
10k/wav/6012.wav|EN-US|EN| It was then that Rangers caught.
10k/wav/6065.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you not go into government buildings?
10k/wav/6122.wav|EN-US|EN| We haven't come out of this very well.
10k/wav/6128.wav|EN-US|EN| He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
10k/wav/613.wav|EN-US|EN| Three weeks later he resigned.
10k/wav/6140.wav|EN-US|EN| You probably have never seen them before.
10k/wav/6158.wav|EN-US|EN| Not all women are dismayed.
10k/wav/6166.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two mysteries.
10k/wav/6167.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a long process.
10k/wav/6168.wav|EN-US|EN| The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a superimposition on the number of bows.
10k/wav/6189.wav|EN-US|EN| He invented the lancut.
10k/wav/62.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two characters.
10k/wav/6206.wav|EN-US|EN| This action could have been avoided.
10k/wav/6220.wav|EN-US|EN| He was travelling to see his daughter.
10k/wav/6225.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the last thing we ever expected.
10k/wav/6255.wav|EN-US|EN| I love a clever reader.
10k/wav/6257.wav|EN-US|EN| They were willing us to get a second.
10k/wav/6279.wav|EN-US|EN| It was fit for royalty.
10k/wav/6284.wav|EN-US|EN| And there are different perspectives.
10k/wav/6286.wav|EN-US|EN| Size is not the issue.
10k/wav/6317.wav|EN-US|EN| That's when the story first appeared.
10k/wav/6323.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
10k/wav/6335.wav|EN-US|EN| We have them in offices over.
10k/wav/6345.wav|EN-US|EN| Next league marches Kilmarnock.
10k/wav/6346.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
10k/wav/6350.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm happy with my form.
10k/wav/6352.wav|EN-US|EN| With all paying for it.
10k/wav/6353.wav|EN-US|EN| I want my country to be a republic, not an empo.
10k/wav/6366.wav|EN-US|EN| I had to come down.
10k/wav/637.wav|EN-US|EN| That could run into millions.
10k/wav/6373.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted to hear this wonderful news.
10k/wav/6376.wav|EN-US|EN| You can't give in to the vandals.
10k/wav/6389.wav|EN-US|EN| Can you imagine a world without design?
10k/wav/6394.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel confident we can turn things down.
10k/wav/6397.wav|EN-US|EN| They always want to give a performance.
10k/wav/6418.wav|EN-US|EN| We need a new kind of theatre.
10k/wav/6443.wav|EN-US|EN| What was this?
10k/wav/6451.wav|EN-US|EN| He is not too young.
10k/wav/648.wav|EN-US|EN| We very much regret that it has occurred.
10k/wav/6489.wav|EN-US|EN| Walls was a prisoner of war.
10k/wav/6505.wav|EN-US|EN| It was still their last night.
10k/wav/651.wav|EN-US|EN| They made up for it on Saturday.
10k/wav/652.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a natural choice for them.
10k/wav/6532.wav|EN-US|EN| The members have vited against it.
10k/wav/6545.wav|EN-US|EN| England and Wales are likely to pull out.
10k/wav/6546.wav|EN-US|EN| That means that nobody can do it.
10k/wav/6554.wav|EN-US|EN| No one wants to talk about death.
10k/wav/6566.wav|EN-US|EN| His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
10k/wav/6569.wav|EN-US|EN| There are a lot of examples.
10k/wav/6570.wav|EN-US|EN| The plane was in flames.
10k/wav/6596.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a dilemma.
10k/wav/6608.wav|EN-US|EN| I would love to do that.
10k/wav/6643.wav|EN-US|EN| He also was in debt to truck dealers.
10k/wav/6662.wav|EN-US|EN| The actors are confident and polished.
10k/wav/6673.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the whole idea.
10k/wav/6679.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a tragedy for the area.
10k/wav/6687.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it must be the uniforms.
10k/wav/670.wav|EN-US|EN| It's good to be back.
10k/wav/671.wav|EN-US|EN| The said our costs were too high.
10k/wav/6710.wav|EN-US|EN| Show level which we consider appropriate.
10k/wav/6713.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all too early.
10k/wav/6716.wav|EN-US|EN| One policeman was killed.
10k/wav/6727.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you from the rugby?
10k/wav/6732.wav|EN-US|EN| This championship is different from the other majors.
10k/wav/6737.wav|EN-US|EN| The characters are always the best attraction.
10k/wav/6754.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to reinforce the pressure on the rock.
10k/wav/6770.wav|EN-US|EN| He played really really well.
10k/wav/6772.wav|EN-US|EN| In addition, investor choices reduced.
10k/wav/6773.wav|EN-US|EN| I could not sit in this tense.
10k/wav/6776.wav|EN-US|EN| But when he left, the decision was forced upon us
10k/wav/6782.wav|EN-US|EN| I will wait until later.
10k/wav/6787.wav|EN-US|EN| Debate is not just talk.
10k/wav/68.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a battle there.
10k/wav/6842.wav|EN-US|EN| You had to go and see him.
10k/wav/6846.wav|EN-US|EN| But it could have been written for her.
10k/wav/6862.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe in public services.
10k/wav/6885.wav|EN-US|EN| He said police enquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
10k/wav/689.wav|EN-US|EN| What does she consider her greatest achievement?
10k/wav/6893.wav|EN-US|EN| I will go back home and see my family.
10k/wav/6897.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been an amazing day.
10k/wav/6907.wav|EN-US|EN| It can work.
10k/wav/6915.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we have a very strong case.
10k/wav/6921.wav|EN-US|EN| He felt that everything that was said about his own seekers was negative.
10k/wav/6929.wav|EN-US|EN| The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
10k/wav/6933.wav|EN-US|EN| Now he will have to start to can
10k/wav/6948.wav|EN-US|EN| I looked forward to it.
10k/wav/6964.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd like to see the business case.
10k/wav/6976.wav|EN-US|EN| This has a number of benefits.
10k/wav/6978.wav|EN-US|EN| He was always nice to me.
10k/wav/6981.wav|EN-US|EN| The processing plant was closed yesterday.
10k/wav/6990.wav|EN-US|EN| I started it, but then forgot all about it.
10k/wav/6994.wav|EN-US|EN| We will make a statement tomorrow.
10k/wav/7006.wav|EN-US|EN| I have friends in Glasgow.
10k/wav/7038.wav|EN-US|EN| It's something he has worked very hard on.
10k/wav/7042.wav|EN-US|EN| Control is major concern in safety.
10k/wav/7043.wav|EN-US|EN| There are feasts to fire on their own countrymen.
10k/wav/7048.wav|EN-US|EN| There is still hope.
10k/wav/7051.wav|EN-US|EN| We came across the first set of bodies.
10k/wav/7063.wav|EN-US|EN| It is good to look back.
10k/wav/7069.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the truth.
10k/wav/7074.wav|EN-US|EN| They need time to think.
10k/wav/7084.wav|EN-US|EN| But it could prove disastrous.
10k/wav/7100.wav|EN-US|EN| Shin said she was there to show my complete support for my husband.
10k/wav/7108.wav|EN-US|EN| And we might go back.
10k/wav/7109.wav|EN-US|EN| Until the weekend, he was Minister for Social Justice.
10k/wav/7112.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a good lifestyle.
10k/wav/7114.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to come clean.
10k/wav/7115.wav|EN-US|EN| It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
10k/wav/7123.wav|EN-US|EN| I would never even consider it.
10k/wav/7135.wav|EN-US|EN| Shemini also said it was unimpressed.
10k/wav/7141.wav|EN-US|EN| Us is the only country to vote against resolution.
10k/wav/7147.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure all schools would accept that.
10k/wav/7151.wav|EN-US|EN| They have been in Scotland on exercise.
10k/wav/7158.wav|EN-US|EN| Put another way, they just want to do it
10k/wav/7164.wav|EN-US|EN| They went to the press.
10k/wav/7170.wav|EN-US|EN| Men should avoid it like the plague.
10k/wav/7179.wav|EN-US|EN| It was really very frightening.
10k/wav/7190.wav|EN-US|EN| I am the manager of Scotland.
10k/wav/7196.wav|EN-US|EN| They are completely different from each other.
10k/wav/7203.wav|EN-US|EN| and they removed a porter.
10k/wav/722.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm going home to see my children.
10k/wav/7222.wav|EN-US|EN| But he is not choosing them.
10k/wav/7235.wav|EN-US|EN| What happened in the summer?
10k/wav/7241.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a major concern about enforcement action.
10k/wav/7246.wav|EN-US|EN| They called in to believe what had happened.
10k/wav/7259.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he would appeal the sentences.
10k/wav/7263.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a theory.
10k/wav/7271.wav|EN-US|EN| The deadline is real and absolute.
10k/wav/7276.wav|EN-US|EN| We are waiting for them to calm down.
10k/wav/7286.wav|EN-US|EN| Another reason is the shortage of stock.
10k/wav/7299.wav|EN-US|EN| We welcome the decision of Mr Pius.
10k/wav/73.wav|EN-US|EN| It is one of those things.
10k/wav/730.wav|EN-US|EN| Labour, Scottish Chair, North Secretary Alex Rawley was delighted yesterday.
10k/wav/7310.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is up again.
10k/wav/7314.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to have a proven track record to get to them.
10k/wav/7315.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just a training thing.
10k/wav/7318.wav|EN-US|EN| We are well with the trouble in all case.
10k/wav/7321.wav|EN-US|EN| They are in the Euro.
10k/wav/7332.wav|EN-US|EN| I was not allowed to say that, of course.
10k/wav/7342.wav|EN-US|EN| So what was he really doing?
10k/wav/7370.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not in denial.
10k/wav/7388.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't know the company or the dwell, or the dancers.
10k/wav/739.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe. Who knows?
10k/wav/7400.wav|EN-US|EN| We are a team of hard workers.
10k/wav/7405.wav|EN-US|EN| They are defined by law.
10k/wav/7418.wav|EN-US|EN| My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
10k/wav/7423.wav|EN-US|EN| Funding for the Science Centre has come from a number of sources.
10k/wav/7426.wav|EN-US|EN| Nor does he have any desire to be.
10k/wav/7438.wav|EN-US|EN| Our numbers are small.
10k/wav/7451.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
10k/wav/7462.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been very happy tonight.
10k/wav/7468.wav|EN-US|EN| Was the punishment excessive?
10k/wav/7476.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
10k/wav/7492.wav|EN-US|EN| She says the royal family got unwell.
10k/wav/7494.wav|EN-US|EN| One person had a broken back
10k/wav/7500.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't it to be.
10k/wav/7504.wav|EN-US|EN| Stock markets will be watching closely.
10k/wav/7515.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an amazing time
10k/wav/752.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a long-term solution
10k/wav/7538.wav|EN-US|EN| Us it was a double. It was pretty expensive.
10k/wav/754.wav|EN-US|EN| He said we are delighted by the vet.
10k/wav/7546.wav|EN-US|EN| He scored one goal and was on fire.
10k/wav/7550.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no disruption to surfaces.
10k/wav/7576.wav|EN-US|EN| No person has been charged.
10k/wav/7581.wav|EN-US|EN| Where is the money coming from?
10k/wav/76.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you think?
10k/wav/7602.wav|EN-US|EN| No one thought about this.
10k/wav/7614.wav|EN-US|EN| It would take some time.
10k/wav/7634.wav|EN-US|EN| For me, it's the tension you can feel.
10k/wav/7659.wav|EN-US|EN| I wouldn't give them a great...
10k/wav/7660.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows the strength of the roots.
10k/wav/7661.wav|EN-US|EN| And then he laughs.
10k/wav/767.wav|EN-US|EN| They should not be blamed for it.
10k/wav/7673.wav|EN-US|EN| will never open.
10k/wav/7679.wav|EN-US|EN| The crackdown is launched today by the government.
10k/wav/768.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a really serious issue.
10k/wav/7684.wav|EN-US|EN| So we started building a home.
10k/wav/769.wav|EN-US|EN| It's changed the very long cut.
10k/wav/7699.wav|EN-US|EN| This has come on too long.
10k/wav/7708.wav|EN-US|EN| What sort of man is that?
10k/wav/7717.wav|EN-US|EN| Because I think it's there.
10k/wav/7718.wav|EN-US|EN| Henman is taking nothing for granted.
10k/wav/7735.wav|EN-US|EN| He was just counting this job.
10k/wav/7737.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to deliver a learning society.
10k/wav/7740.wav|EN-US|EN| She hears of building a business will go up in smoke.
10k/wav/7743.wav|EN-US|EN| Why should he go anywhere?
10k/wav/7747.wav|EN-US|EN| They will know they deserve to be there.
10k/wav/776.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not the end of the matter, of course.
10k/wav/7763.wav|EN-US|EN| This is usually done by the space shuttle.
10k/wav/7767.wav|EN-US|EN| No one can take it in.
10k/wav/7770.wav|EN-US|EN| It had all been aged.
10k/wav/7772.wav|EN-US|EN| Both of them have lickscoot
10k/wav/7779.wav|EN-US|EN| The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
10k/wav/7818.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not like us.
10k/wav/782.wav|EN-US|EN| I always knew she was funny.
10k/wav/7825.wav|EN-US|EN| Scott's actors should be so lucky.
10k/wav/7838.wav|EN-US|EN| It is still on to discussion with the board.
10k/wav/7848.wav|EN-US|EN| The very previous winners also came from Scotland.
10k/wav/7879.wav|EN-US|EN| This idea is a good starting point.
10k/wav/7884.wav|EN-US|EN| Who is he?
10k/wav/791.wav|EN-US|EN| We should be capable of managing it though.
10k/wav/7912.wav|EN-US|EN| He is the man to beat.
10k/wav/7924.wav|EN-US|EN| Let he remains confident enough.
10k/wav/7928.wav|EN-US|EN| Peter doesn't want to leave.
10k/wav/7931.wav|EN-US|EN| They know no other way.
10k/wav/7957.wav|EN-US|EN| The British public is nothing if not fatal.
10k/wav/7958.wav|EN-US|EN| Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
10k/wav/7959.wav|EN-US|EN| We'll start the training forward
10k/wav/7966.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is different in different regions.
10k/wav/7987.wav|EN-US|EN| It was then we possible decision.
10k/wav/7994.wav|EN-US|EN| We will miss him against Celtic.
10k/wav/800.wav|EN-US|EN| But it didn't happen.
10k/wav/8005.wav|EN-US|EN| It has a blow.
10k/wav/8014.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a fossil on screen.
10k/wav/8015.wav|EN-US|EN| The boss are mentally focused.
10k/wav/8032.wav|EN-US|EN| He was asked it, but later released without church.
10k/wav/8041.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the right thing.
10k/wav/8066.wav|EN-US|EN| Night has become a big picture.
10k/wav/8067.wav|EN-US|EN| because it's a waste of time for both sides.
10k/wav/8070.wav|EN-US|EN| It was quite a sight.
10k/wav/8078.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a Satan.
10k/wav/8081.wav|EN-US|EN| The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
10k/wav/8089.wav|EN-US|EN| Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
10k/wav/8090.wav|EN-US|EN| She is in good spurts.
10k/wav/8091.wav|EN-US|EN| This doesn't have to be our future.
10k/wav/8112.wav|EN-US|EN| Barring power was one of those improvements.
10k/wav/8144.wav|EN-US|EN| He must be seen to be impartial.
10k/wav/8149.wav|EN-US|EN| After that he became more romantic.
10k/wav/8150.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been in good form for the last two years.
10k/wav/8176.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything was an effort.
10k/wav/8184.wav|EN-US|EN| Therefore there is a threat.
10k/wav/8198.wav|EN-US|EN| So what makes it so special?
10k/wav/8215.wav|EN-US|EN| That is impressive by any standards.
10k/wav/8219.wav|EN-US|EN| Things are going very well.
10k/wav/8233.wav|EN-US|EN| No doubt the Council would welcome the proposal.
10k/wav/8238.wav|EN-US|EN| Further growth will be funded from Cash Flow.
10k/wav/8242.wav|EN-US|EN| Except, this time, it seems, he really really means it.
10k/wav/8244.wav|EN-US|EN| But we could only help a handful of people.
10k/wav/8247.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm ready to go.
10k/wav/8270.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
10k/wav/8272.wav|EN-US|EN| You thought it was a headache.
10k/wav/8285.wav|EN-US|EN| The festival runs until Tuesday.
10k/wav/8287.wav|EN-US|EN| The bill would be massive.
10k/wav/829.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd never heard anything like it before.
10k/wav/8298.wav|EN-US|EN| We have great confidence in Derek.
10k/wav/8301.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going to see a government in high.
10k/wav/8311.wav|EN-US|EN| We are great to disagree.
10k/wav/8312.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel like it's time to make the switch
10k/wav/8317.wav|EN-US|EN| He said the tractor had been completely friendly.
10k/wav/8323.wav|EN-US|EN| That, he claimed, was essential
10k/wav/8328.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been like that for ages according to the guys.
10k/wav/8333.wav|EN-US|EN| Services are being expanded too.
10k/wav/834.wav|EN-US|EN| The answer I hope includes the government, colloid and Westminster.
10k/wav/8341.wav|EN-US|EN| There is an element of racism in Scotland.
10k/wav/835.wav|EN-US|EN| They were in a stable condition last night.
10k/wav/8355.wav|EN-US|EN| There is something in this.
10k/wav/836.wav|EN-US|EN| She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
10k/wav/8362.wav|EN-US|EN| Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the hell of Moray.
10k/wav/8371.wav|EN-US|EN| I stayed away from the defence.
10k/wav/8372.wav|EN-US|EN| Many innocent people will die.
10k/wav/8374.wav|EN-US|EN| We were hopeful that it would be successful.
10k/wav/8375.wav|EN-US|EN| You can feel the tension in the air.
10k/wav/8380.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the crowning point of my grare.
10k/wav/8381.wav|EN-US|EN| We were never tailored, it was already decided.
10k/wav/8395.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
10k/wav/8396.wav|EN-US|EN| as it should be.
10k/wav/8401.wav|EN-US|EN| It added to the reverence.
10k/wav/8405.wav|EN-US|EN| They've got some extremely good players.
10k/wav/8408.wav|EN-US|EN| The next few months will tell.
10k/wav/8426.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the logical consequence of the formula.
10k/wav/8432.wav|EN-US|EN| About time, T, you might think.
10k/wav/8435.wav|EN-US|EN| Within three days, he was dead.
10k/wav/8450.wav|EN-US|EN| Four minutes later, the show was over.
10k/wav/8477.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems a waste of talents.
10k/wav/8491.wav|EN-US|EN| That was then, and this is now.
10k/wav/8513.wav|EN-US|EN| What then is the real thing?
10k/wav/8528.wav|EN-US|EN| More cases are expected.
10k/wav/8533.wav|EN-US|EN| He has changed Marr forever.
10k/wav/8538.wav|EN-US|EN| I will have to get and impress.
10k/wav/8542.wav|EN-US|EN| This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
10k/wav/8550.wav|EN-US|EN| Others said he had gone too far.
10k/wav/8551.wav|EN-US|EN| It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
10k/wav/8558.wav|EN-US|EN| It is serious upon not that serious.
10k/wav/8562.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a high quality product.
10k/wav/8563.wav|EN-US|EN| That might help a bit.
10k/wav/8574.wav|EN-US|EN| I knew my contract was up this year.
10k/wav/8579.wav|EN-US|EN| We will not give up on the truth.
10k/wav/8632.wav|EN-US|EN| He added the old system has reached its limits.
10k/wav/864.wav|EN-US|EN| But they were never expected to last.
10k/wav/8644.wav|EN-US|EN| They were very very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
10k/wav/866.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Bly should be warned.
10k/wav/8668.wav|EN-US|EN| Cine management in Scotland throws weight behind the orchestra.
10k/wav/8670.wav|EN-US|EN| He will become the sovereign.
10k/wav/8671.wav|EN-US|EN| We do the same.
10k/wav/8675.wav|EN-US|EN| It had been accepted.
10k/wav/8679.wav|EN-US|EN| The announcement was made off to inquiries from a national newspaper.
10k/wav/868.wav|EN-US|EN| It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
10k/wav/8680.wav|EN-US|EN| Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
10k/wav/8690.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to win this thing.
10k/wav/8697.wav|EN-US|EN| Hall-Taylor, a spokesman for the American University, confirmed the appointment yesterday.
10k/wav/87.wav|EN-US|EN| Always busy, but not much is happening.
10k/wav/8720.wav|EN-US|EN| It's such a troll
10k/wav/8737.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you alright at the front?
10k/wav/8747.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very passionate about my country.
10k/wav/8759.wav|EN-US|EN| This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
10k/wav/8761.wav|EN-US|EN| Another difference is the cost.
10k/wav/8765.wav|EN-US|EN| You take a risk.
10k/wav/8775.wav|EN-US|EN| We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
10k/wav/8782.wav|EN-US|EN| That can only be a good thing.
10k/wav/8800.wav|EN-US|EN| You have no chance of planning permission.
10k/wav/8801.wav|EN-US|EN| and so it goes on.
10k/wav/881.wav|EN-US|EN| All the pieces fit together perfectly.
10k/wav/8815.wav|EN-US|EN| years ago it was really quite simple
10k/wav/8825.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Smith was dismissive.
10k/wav/8827.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be quite nice.
10k/wav/8831.wav|EN-US|EN| Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe
10k/wav/8840.wav|EN-US|EN| Does it make a profit?
10k/wav/8852.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
10k/wav/8864.wav|EN-US|EN| The partners are looking for answers.
10k/wav/887.wav|EN-US|EN| I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
10k/wav/8880.wav|EN-US|EN| Our biggest threat is the BBC.
10k/wav/889.wav|EN-US|EN| It was Celtic.
10k/wav/8896.wav|EN-US|EN| This is great news for us.
10k/wav/8912.wav|EN-US|EN| I was pleased about that.
10k/wav/8913.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
10k/wav/8914.wav|EN-US|EN| I will never have problems with any football managers.
10k/wav/8934.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought so was his family.
10k/wav/8956.wav|EN-US|EN| The case will not go to appeal.
10k/wav/8957.wav|EN-US|EN| We need a visionary producer.
10k/wav/8975.wav|EN-US|EN| The growth potential is enormous.
10k/wav/8978.wav|EN-US|EN| Report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
10k/wav/8983.wav|EN-US|EN| I think every coach wants to work daily.
10k/wav/8992.wav|EN-US|EN| It is almost like a family.
10k/wav/9007.wav|EN-US|EN| Bombing slaughter rejected.
10k/wav/9019.wav|EN-US|EN| There's the chance they might come down
10k/wav/9033.wav|EN-US|EN| with our talking team.
10k/wav/904.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you think they would do any better?
10k/wav/905.wav|EN-US|EN| Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
10k/wav/9055.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a dangerous trip to make for these people.
10k/wav/9076.wav|EN-US|EN| An aide was instructed to get a copy.
10k/wav/9077.wav|EN-US|EN| Costs have got to be controlled.
10k/wav/9096.wav|EN-US|EN| He liked was very substitute.
10k/wav/9107.wav|EN-US|EN| Today we begin to answer that question.
10k/wav/9114.wav|EN-US|EN| No reason was given.
10k/wav/9122.wav|EN-US|EN| This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
10k/wav/9126.wav|EN-US|EN| This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
10k/wav/9134.wav|EN-US|EN| It is so unfair.
10k/wav/9159.wav|EN-US|EN| As for the warning, it was not needed
10k/wav/9187.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, it counted.
10k/wav/9188.wav|EN-US|EN| His ambition was made this year when he played or sighted his son.
10k/wav/919.wav|EN-US|EN| Little Coles are his victims.
10k/wav/9192.wav|EN-US|EN| I just wanted to fly.
10k/wav/9193.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still in talks and hopefully they will continue.
10k/wav/9204.wav|EN-US|EN| It is only the beginning.
10k/wav/921.wav|EN-US|EN| They believed it walked.
10k/wav/9229.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a U10.
10k/wav/9236.wav|EN-US|EN| I could not have hoped to run at this level.
10k/wav/9245.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a substantial explosion.
10k/wav/9254.wav|EN-US|EN| We have the mental strength.
10k/wav/9258.wav|EN-US|EN| But it won't be the same.
10k/wav/9263.wav|EN-US|EN| We've tried every other way.
10k/wav/9271.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
10k/wav/9282.wav|EN-US|EN| He said wearing position is quite simple.
10k/wav/9305.wav|EN-US|EN| We just want them home.
10k/wav/931.wav|EN-US|EN| I have got to keep the lid on.
10k/wav/9326.wav|EN-US|EN| This was not helpful.
10k/wav/9331.wav|EN-US|EN| Our position is extremely simple.
10k/wav/9359.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a Simangan garden there
10k/wav/9365.wav|EN-US|EN| It would have to be backdated.
10k/wav/9368.wav|EN-US|EN| He refused to discuss his inventory tarot.
10k/wav/9374.wav|EN-US|EN| I would be interested in another attempt.
10k/wav/9401.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no room for horror.
10k/wav/944.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
10k/wav/9444.wav|EN-US|EN| Her granddaughter was an injured.
10k/wav/9456.wav|EN-US|EN| It is crucial for both teams.
10k/wav/9459.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe that the answer is simple.
10k/wav/9461.wav|EN-US|EN| The conductors too will have adjustments to make.
10k/wav/9476.wav|EN-US|EN| No other offers apply.
10k/wav/9487.wav|EN-US|EN| They are a total disgrace to the lawless cause.
10k/wav/9490.wav|EN-US|EN| 1. The acute services trust will run the channel hospital services
10k/wav/9495.wav|EN-US|EN| It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
10k/wav/951.wav|EN-US|EN| Some examples are presented in detail.
10k/wav/9517.wav|EN-US|EN| Indeed, it is only the beginning.
10k/wav/9527.wav|EN-US|EN| How our playlist is to be head this week.
10k/wav/953.wav|EN-US|EN| I can live with it.
10k/wav/9530.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a big step up.
10k/wav/9535.wav|EN-US|EN| It took on three minutes from beginning to end.
10k/wav/9539.wav|EN-US|EN| What's the problem with change?
10k/wav/9546.wav|EN-US|EN| The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Forredu in October.
10k/wav/9548.wav|EN-US|EN| The roll was a not cut, but really difficult.
10k/wav/9550.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a sort of a mistoo figure.
10k/wav/9556.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a crisis without a doubt.
10k/wav/9570.wav|EN-US|EN| Mikaiti said it would locus other means of tackling market abuse.
10k/wav/958.wav|EN-US|EN| Center is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
10k/wav/9583.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you watching Liverpool?
10k/wav/9597.wav|EN-US|EN| I said he was set to retire
10k/wav/9603.wav|EN-US|EN| Where will the elderly go then?
10k/wav/9608.wav|EN-US|EN| The devil is the creator of weapons.
10k/wav/961.wav|EN-US|EN| It's terrible that this is happening.
10k/wav/9615.wav|EN-US|EN| Even the Labour Party is one thing.
10k/wav/9621.wav|EN-US|EN| The position on the euro remains unchanged.
10k/wav/9624.wav|EN-US|EN| Whenever we said about this decision, we protested.
10k/wav/9633.wav|EN-US|EN| T, is there anything in the want?
10k/wav/9645.wav|EN-US|EN| We have several options.
10k/wav/9654.wav|EN-US|EN| They must do it.
10k/wav/9664.wav|EN-US|EN| Patients will be partners in decision making.
10k/wav/97.wav|EN-US|EN| It is safe in our hands.
10k/wav/970.wav|EN-US|EN| When is it ever anything else?
10k/wav/9717.wav|EN-US|EN| Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
10k/wav/9734.wav|EN-US|EN| But it has been an amazing experience.
10k/wav/9757.wav|EN-US|EN| Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
10k/wav/9761.wav|EN-US|EN| The government yesterday announced its proposed new Punch-in account
10k/wav/9768.wav|EN-US|EN| Calm with them is any sense of narrative.
10k/wav/9775.wav|EN-US|EN| Eye game is in pretty good shape.
10k/wav/9784.wav|EN-US|EN| A great player has to win major championships.
10k/wav/9797.wav|EN-US|EN| A home office spokeswoman said she was unable to comment on individual cases.
10k/wav/9802.wav|EN-US|EN| We are right at the heart of Europe.
10k/wav/982.wav|EN-US|EN| The work with Alison was a great experience.
10k/wav/9824.wav|EN-US|EN| I could do a better job.
10k/wav/9864.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a recipe for conflict.
10k/wav/9865.wav|EN-US|EN| If you come get it.
10k/wav/9884.wav|EN-US|EN| Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
10k/wav/9907.wav|EN-US|EN| It would cause a little bit of disruption.
10k/wav/9914.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything else is second.
10k/wav/9922.wav|EN-US|EN| He thought she was amazing.
10k/wav/9945.wav|EN-US|EN| He also admitted.
10k/wav/9951.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an option but I can't really comment.
10k/wav/9964.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you do?
10k/wav/9986.wav|EN-US|EN| I would like to stay with Rangers.
10k/wav/9989.wav|EN-US|EN| We expect to come through on Thursday.
10k/wav/9999.wav|EN-US|EN| But then, that really is the point
10k/wav/1014.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a huge turn at all.
10k/wav/1016.wav|EN-US|EN| It is important that he is involved.
10k/wav/103.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm also delighted for all the players.
10k/wav/1050.wav|EN-US|EN| He was part of the family.
10k/wav/1066.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a defining moment in this parliament.
10k/wav/1076.wav|EN-US|EN| Blair is very positive at GOP in councils.
10k/wav/1083.wav|EN-US|EN| Four other charges were dropped.
10k/wav/1092.wav|EN-US|EN| If so, they were wrong
10k/wav/1096.wav|EN-US|EN| They have admitted they cannot meet that athlete.
10k/wav/1100.wav|EN-US|EN| The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
10k/wav/1122.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a case of pity for us.
10k/wav/1127.wav|EN-US|EN| Bisocial devices. The two groups are coming together.
10k/wav/1149.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a lot of pressure on me.
10k/wav/1173.wav|EN-US|EN| The British government said she was coming home.
10k/wav/1174.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't and it worked for us.
10k/wav/1180.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the devil is in the detail.
10k/wav/1185.wav|EN-US|EN| The believer is indigenous to movie.
10k/wav/1186.wav|EN-US|EN| The prognosis is excellent.
10k/wav/1198.wav|EN-US|EN| It is going to change the world.
10k/wav/12.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a joke.
10k/wav/1200.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
10k/wav/1201.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no shortage of commitment.
10k/wav/1203.wav|EN-US|EN| The company has other problems with the shelves.
10k/wav/1210.wav|EN-US|EN| Does a firefighter have to be killed?
10k/wav/1214.wav|EN-US|EN| But the organizers refused to weigh.
10k/wav/1216.wav|EN-US|EN| Instead another depression came in.
10k/wav/1219.wav|EN-US|EN| It's really no great surprise because the price difference is so much.
10k/wav/1236.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a tactical change.
10k/wav/1242.wav|EN-US|EN| The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
10k/wav/1249.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the Tate.
10k/wav/125.wav|EN-US|EN| He was married with the Aunt Chaset.
10k/wav/1253.wav|EN-US|EN| So what does 1 do?
10k/wav/1300.wav|EN-US|EN| We couldn't go very fast.
10k/wav/1307.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been very nervous.
10k/wav/1312.wav|EN-US|EN| Good plays have become bad.
10k/wav/1326.wav|EN-US|EN| He was confronted by police.
10k/wav/1328.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the interesting part.
10k/wav/1356.wav|EN-US|EN| It goes back a long way.
10k/wav/1362.wav|EN-US|EN| And that was just about that.
10k/wav/1397.wav|EN-US|EN| That is nearly four people every day.
10k/wav/1419.wav|EN-US|EN| However, you have just got to adjust it
10k/wav/1431.wav|EN-US|EN| Things start to talk to each other.
10k/wav/1437.wav|EN-US|EN| These elements are not in the book.
10k/wav/145.wav|EN-US|EN| It's such a niggasy hope.
10k/wav/1450.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been together for five years.
10k/wav/1457.wav|EN-US|EN| It might have led to screencare, but it didn't.
10k/wav/147.wav|EN-US|EN| He also does not get along with Christina.
10k/wav/1478.wav|EN-US|EN| We felt at the moment it was not possible.
10k/wav/1482.wav|EN-US|EN| It was more like a Labour party rally.
10k/wav/151.wav|EN-US|EN| Not that accuracy was a believer.
10k/wav/1515.wav|EN-US|EN| The cabinet is split over the issue.
10k/wav/152.wav|EN-US|EN| It didn't put me off.
10k/wav/1530.wav|EN-US|EN| Detectives are waiting to interview the men
10k/wav/154.wav|EN-US|EN| She made no further comment.
10k/wav/1545.wav|EN-US|EN| He is lying to save his skin.
10k/wav/1548.wav|EN-US|EN| The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
10k/wav/1552.wav|EN-US|EN| No, she will not be running at all.
10k/wav/1556.wav|EN-US|EN| This isn't some form of commission.
10k/wav/1564.wav|EN-US|EN| Barry will be able to handle this.
10k/wav/1565.wav|EN-US|EN| I may think about performing it.
10k/wav/1592.wav|EN-US|EN| Perming is the easy option.
10k/wav/1594.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no reports of casualties.
10k/wav/1598.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
10k/wav/1610.wav|EN-US|EN| It's still got that at its heart.
10k/wav/1614.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the way of making a mark.
10k/wav/1617.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
10k/wav/1626.wav|EN-US|EN| They are not the answer to stuff shortages.
10k/wav/165.wav|EN-US|EN| It was different from other work.
10k/wav/1657.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure you all can relate to that
10k/wav/1661.wav|EN-US|EN| That was never their agenda.
10k/wav/1668.wav|EN-US|EN| The professor said the results were positive.
10k/wav/1671.wav|EN-US|EN| Winnie was very creative.
10k/wav/1686.wav|EN-US|EN| Scheming would be equally difficult.
10k/wav/1689.wav|EN-US|EN| They wanted to shut the Scottish office.
10k/wav/1690.wav|EN-US|EN| Secondly, there is the question of money.
10k/wav/1692.wav|EN-US|EN| I have nothing to lose.
10k/wav/1701.wav|EN-US|EN| It's really nothing new.
10k/wav/1710.wav|EN-US|EN| I have got a knife.
10k/wav/1712.wav|EN-US|EN| I ever came against any cylinders.
10k/wav/1734.wav|EN-US|EN| but they also netted a partial strength in the loss of evidence.
10k/wav/1738.wav|EN-US|EN| Say it looks like a dundio.
10k/wav/1743.wav|EN-US|EN| His home is provided by the government.
10k/wav/1758.wav|EN-US|EN| My thoughts are with their families.
10k/wav/1764.wav|EN-US|EN| These guys will not lie down.
10k/wav/1770.wav|EN-US|EN| They're great to meet.
10k/wav/1775.wav|EN-US|EN| But this isn't to play about the troubles.
10k/wav/1776.wav|EN-US|EN| I really wanted the part.
10k/wav/1792.wav|EN-US|EN| I was proud of our LUTs.
10k/wav/1796.wav|EN-US|EN| It's better than that. It's fantastic.
10k/wav/1804.wav|EN-US|EN| Filtering through this material, I composite file any images.
10k/wav/1811.wav|EN-US|EN| It has no chance.
10k/wav/1819.wav|EN-US|EN| I have always loved the countryside.
10k/wav/1847.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to focus on what is important.
10k/wav/1850.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's make him a J
10k/wav/1869.wav|EN-US|EN| However, we had no failures in our side.
10k/wav/187.wav|EN-US|EN| I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that throw.
10k/wav/1894.wav|EN-US|EN| Our facts have been marvellous.
10k/wav/1902.wav|EN-US|EN| It raises a serious question mark.
10k/wav/1911.wav|EN-US|EN| The loss temp trend is equally clear.
10k/wav/1927.wav|EN-US|EN| You should be there with six different characters.
10k/wav/1936.wav|EN-US|EN| There were good years for him.
10k/wav/1938.wav|EN-US|EN| We hope this scheme will change that.
10k/wav/1948.wav|EN-US|EN| We should be rewarded for producing.
10k/wav/1955.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday Abinarshan said it had injected further capital into a Scottish provident.
10k/wav/1956.wav|EN-US|EN| Pray that it is so.
10k/wav/1962.wav|EN-US|EN| The idea was presented to me.
10k/wav/1967.wav|EN-US|EN| What are they like?
10k/wav/1973.wav|EN-US|EN| He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
10k/wav/1977.wav|EN-US|EN| English is the lamcote of pop music
10k/wav/1989.wav|EN-US|EN| We'd be very fortunate to have these new projects to focus on.
10k/wav/1994.wav|EN-US|EN| Is your laugh a little too easy?
10k/wav/200.wav|EN-US|EN| We just asked the three points.
10k/wav/2015.wav|EN-US|EN| Some of his family is still alive though
10k/wav/2046.wav|EN-US|EN| This could be a recipe for conflict.
10k/wav/2069.wav|EN-US|EN| Rangers deserve to beat us.
10k/wav/2118.wav|EN-US|EN| You could fail the heat.
10k/wav/2121.wav|EN-US|EN| You must be ready to play anyone.
10k/wav/2125.wav|EN-US|EN| In addition, it was in preach of natural justice.
10k/wav/2127.wav|EN-US|EN| It comes down to the police in England.
10k/wav/2132.wav|EN-US|EN| This is my personal assessment.
10k/wav/2160.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an insult.
10k/wav/220.wav|EN-US|EN| This could take a few days.
10k/wav/2210.wav|EN-US|EN| It just isn't a defining issue for them.
10k/wav/2216.wav|EN-US|EN| Is it the flight?
10k/wav/2225.wav|EN-US|EN| It requires a wider team.
10k/wav/2235.wav|EN-US|EN| We cannot go on like this.
10k/wav/2238.wav|EN-US|EN| Our idea is to show and know the cost.
10k/wav/225.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a human tragedy.
10k/wav/2263.wav|EN-US|EN| It makes no difference to their friendship.
10k/wav/2268.wav|EN-US|EN| The power of religion is so strong.
10k/wav/2275.wav|EN-US|EN| I never agreed with that.
10k/wav/2276.wav|EN-US|EN| The post will be unpaid.
10k/wav/2283.wav|EN-US|EN| Then 8 will be fantastic.
10k/wav/2287.wav|EN-US|EN| He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
10k/wav/2294.wav|EN-US|EN| After the match, do you?
10k/wav/2297.wav|EN-US|EN| It was horrible, but there is still more.
10k/wav/2331.wav|EN-US|EN| They did the right thing.
10k/wav/2335.wav|EN-US|EN| as it is unlikely to be the full or final.
10k/wav/235.wav|EN-US|EN| I've become here for the jersey.
10k/wav/236.wav|EN-US|EN| I enjoy the creative process.
10k/wav/2375.wav|EN-US|EN| A great deal has been achieved.
10k/wav/2376.wav|EN-US|EN| That said the tone.
10k/wav/2379.wav|EN-US|EN| Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
10k/wav/2387.wav|EN-US|EN| Other forces were however at work.
10k/wav/2394.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to play at the highest level.
10k/wav/2403.wav|EN-US|EN| I will report in the spring.
10k/wav/2407.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd still pretty young in this business.
10k/wav/2417.wav|EN-US|EN| I have received no explanation.
10k/wav/2419.wav|EN-US|EN| With him are the symbols of his faith.
10k/wav/2421.wav|EN-US|EN| If a national company, you must provide it all.
10k/wav/2426.wav|EN-US|EN| He was summit.
10k/wav/2432.wav|EN-US|EN| We have understood the problems for some time.
10k/wav/2445.wav|EN-US|EN| My goal is quite simple.
10k/wav/2450.wav|EN-US|EN| Stuff were invited to make their own proposals.
10k/wav/2465.wav|EN-US|EN| I found a fort and it worked at it.
10k/wav/2473.wav|EN-US|EN| That meant the search was unlawful.
10k/wav/2484.wav|EN-US|EN| Mental health is a massive issue.
10k/wav/2485.wav|EN-US|EN| We will stand for the nation.
10k/wav/2499.wav|EN-US|EN| His three year appointment begins on Monday.
10k/wav/2513.wav|EN-US|EN| They feel it belongs to them.
10k/wav/2522.wav|EN-US|EN| They are not collapsing.
10k/wav/2526.wav|EN-US|EN| He will want to utilise the medfield.
10k/wav/2565.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, it's not before time, is it?
10k/wav/2572.wav|EN-US|EN| This is an interesting link.
10k/wav/2580.wav|EN-US|EN| I have fallen in love with the Harlands.
10k/wav/2589.wav|EN-US|EN| Dumpfamel manager Jimmy Kordewitt was candid.
10k/wav/259.wav|EN-US|EN| It should have taken you for a company this size.
10k/wav/2593.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems to be politics at work again.
10k/wav/2598.wav|EN-US|EN| Time remains to put other candidates forward.
10k/wav/2602.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a totally different order of agreement.
10k/wav/2623.wav|EN-US|EN| What's then is wrong?
10k/wav/263.wav|EN-US|EN| Athletics is on a roll in the country.
10k/wav/266.wav|EN-US|EN| And that's it.
10k/wav/2668.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been pleased about one thing.
10k/wav/2671.wav|EN-US|EN| The rice has come too late for some.
10k/wav/2683.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't expect to get one.
10k/wav/2688.wav|EN-US|EN| Their extinction is not inevitable.
10k/wav/2692.wav|EN-US|EN| He was in great spirits.
10k/wav/2695.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone out at the club was supportive.
10k/wav/2699.wav|EN-US|EN| Many events are down or numbers.
10k/wav/2701.wav|EN-US|EN| Cockwood was nested.
10k/wav/2717.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no way to do this.
10k/wav/2721.wav|EN-US|EN| That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
10k/wav/2731.wav|EN-US|EN| I am trying to be relaxed about the future.
10k/wav/2739.wav|EN-US|EN| I was not happy about being left out.
10k/wav/2758.wav|EN-US|EN| We could soon be in that same position.
10k/wav/2762.wav|EN-US|EN| The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
10k/wav/2767.wav|EN-US|EN| We were looking for a base.
10k/wav/2777.wav|EN-US|EN| His female companion was being treated for shock.
10k/wav/2785.wav|EN-US|EN| The story was not made public by this club.
10k/wav/2796.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe we can handle this okay.
10k/wav/2801.wav|EN-US|EN| The aircraft was totally destroyed
10k/wav/2817.wav|EN-US|EN| It is too close to call
10k/wav/2826.wav|EN-US|EN| It meant a lot to us.
10k/wav/284.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not the way we should operate.
10k/wav/2870.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a big day.
10k/wav/2873.wav|EN-US|EN| The boy in the sixth sense is not alone.
10k/wav/2885.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the biggest surprise of my life.
10k/wav/2889.wav|EN-US|EN| We have nothing to say about that.
10k/wav/2909.wav|EN-US|EN| This plan is all about to respect.
10k/wav/2916.wav|EN-US|EN| The port is currently resolving its differences.
10k/wav/2921.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no change in principle from the white paper.
10k/wav/2937.wav|EN-US|EN| I was given no instructions by no one.
10k/wav/2958.wav|EN-US|EN| I wondered about changing back to rugby.
10k/wav/2960.wav|EN-US|EN| We recognise it as a key area.
10k/wav/2972.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no reports of any injuries.
10k/wav/2978.wav|EN-US|EN| He was very grateful for his health.
10k/wav/2983.wav|EN-US|EN| Puz looks straight ahead.
10k/wav/2987.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
10k/wav/3000.wav|EN-US|EN| We cowed an empty faudit.
10k/wav/3016.wav|EN-US|EN| Why change it?
10k/wav/3034.wav|EN-US|EN| You are a great player.
10k/wav/3054.wav|EN-US|EN| There is nothing to be gained from that.
10k/wav/3069.wav|EN-US|EN| How is he enjoying life as a senior?
10k/wav/3087.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope you will leave it at that.
10k/wav/3088.wav|EN-US|EN| The scheme has been funded by the government
10k/wav/3095.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not very pleased.
10k/wav/3097.wav|EN-US|EN| But we are very near.
10k/wav/310.wav|EN-US|EN| For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
10k/wav/3101.wav|EN-US|EN| He had lost his confidence again.
10k/wav/3103.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope it has helped the prisoners.
10k/wav/3111.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no hint of bravado.
10k/wav/3113.wav|EN-US|EN| It sounded like a pom.
10k/wav/3155.wav|EN-US|EN| The chummin had a point to make.
10k/wav/3156.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly the sticks are high.
10k/wav/3163.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the window
10k/wav/3166.wav|EN-US|EN| We used to keep our business rates.
10k/wav/3176.wav|EN-US|EN| Conebation is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.
10k/wav/3180.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the sensible outcome.
10k/wav/3186.wav|EN-US|EN| On the contrary, it was actually very funny
10k/wav/3191.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm greatly uncoached.
10k/wav/3204.wav|EN-US|EN| That may be.
10k/wav/3207.wav|EN-US|EN| She is currently the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Transport.
10k/wav/3208.wav|EN-US|EN| The creditors have lost a lot.
10k/wav/3257.wav|EN-US|EN| The company reacted very well.
10k/wav/3272.wav|EN-US|EN| Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
10k/wav/3274.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday, her family were too upset to speak.
10k/wav/3280.wav|EN-US|EN| It was known about them.
10k/wav/3288.wav|EN-US|EN| He is married with two children.
10k/wav/3296.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd be so much respect for him.
10k/wav/3297.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you want to say?
10k/wav/3305.wav|EN-US|EN| His fears are hardly surprising.
10k/wav/3314.wav|EN-US|EN| But too nice.
10k/wav/3317.wav|EN-US|EN| But it does not matter.
10k/wav/3329.wav|EN-US|EN| The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
10k/wav/3333.wav|EN-US|EN| It was located on the remote control
10k/wav/3363.wav|EN-US|EN| I was in daily contact.
10k/wav/3382.wav|EN-US|EN| We have made a commitment to those people.
10k/wav/3385.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be no repeat of that performance that I can guarantee.
10k/wav/339.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm happy to play for Aberdeen.
10k/wav/3394.wav|EN-US|EN| We can interhabit both ways.
10k/wav/34.wav|EN-US|EN| We had to work very hard for our points.
10k/wav/342.wav|EN-US|EN| It was one year.
10k/wav/3428.wav|EN-US|EN| I would love it.
10k/wav/343.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the day she thought she would never see.
10k/wav/3438.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought he did very well.
10k/wav/3497.wav|EN-US|EN| If he does not leave he will be shot.
10k/wav/352.wav|EN-US|EN| It has all been done in secret.
10k/wav/3528.wav|EN-US|EN| It isn't a pair to be anything too serious.
10k/wav/3535.wav|EN-US|EN| I just wanted to get off the course.
10k/wav/3543.wav|EN-US|EN| They've been at it for five hours.
10k/wav/3546.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very, very happy.
10k/wav/3566.wav|EN-US|EN| Both sides have to step back.
10k/wav/3580.wav|EN-US|EN| No success for disabled people.
10k/wav/3584.wav|EN-US|EN| It is an expensive part of their equipment.
10k/wav/3585.wav|EN-US|EN| Was everything done to save people?
10k/wav/3586.wav|EN-US|EN| Nacional Farmatsunen of Scotland President Tim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
10k/wav/3596.wav|EN-US|EN| It might be useful to have something in black and white.
10k/wav/3612.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a very difficult period.
10k/wav/3613.wav|EN-US|EN| Having done it, he was asked again
10k/wav/3619.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not a monies admirers
10k/wav/3649.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still catching signals.
10k/wav/366.wav|EN-US|EN| Others are not so sure.
10k/wav/3660.wav|EN-US|EN| Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
10k/wav/3665.wav|EN-US|EN| Bellini was attracted to women.
10k/wav/3669.wav|EN-US|EN| Suddenly, the Fair Park site ran to Surrey.
10k/wav/3671.wav|EN-US|EN| However, our players will fight for that
10k/wav/3693.wav|EN-US|EN| The party will make up its own mind.
10k/wav/3695.wav|EN-US|EN| Each others have followed.
10k/wav/3696.wav|EN-US|EN| His first album was of it.
10k/wav/37.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, this article is a bit like that
10k/wav/3730.wav|EN-US|EN| You're not going to forget something like that.
10k/wav/3736.wav|EN-US|EN| Our decision making was poor.
10k/wav/3756.wav|EN-US|EN| The pressure on aid agencies is immense.
10k/wav/3761.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got better players here.
10k/wav/3766.wav|EN-US|EN| They are so easy for the ancestors to ripen
10k/wav/3767.wav|EN-US|EN| I think they should have more respect.
10k/wav/3771.wav|EN-US|EN| A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Deere.
10k/wav/3774.wav|EN-US|EN| This pattern will also return.
10k/wav/3776.wav|EN-US|EN| Chop losses were also announced.
10k/wav/3793.wav|EN-US|EN| Something old, something new, as it were
10k/wav/3801.wav|EN-US|EN| We needed someone and we now have him.
10k/wav/3810.wav|EN-US|EN| Who will deliver most of us to Scotland?
10k/wav/3817.wav|EN-US|EN| Then he asks,
10k/wav/3820.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted for them.
10k/wav/3824.wav|EN-US|EN| I just have no maternal instincts.
10k/wav/3838.wav|EN-US|EN| If a service doesn't pay it will go.
10k/wav/3843.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe they will see sense.
10k/wav/3848.wav|EN-US|EN| She told the Herald.
10k/wav/3852.wav|EN-US|EN| I have not had much of him.
10k/wav/3856.wav|EN-US|EN| They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
10k/wav/3860.wav|EN-US|EN| With the hat home, which is important.
10k/wav/3875.wav|EN-US|EN| I never want to have any children.
10k/wav/3881.wav|EN-US|EN| The Little Bill was playing football at lunchtime.
10k/wav/3892.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the difference.
10k/wav/3912.wav|EN-US|EN| It looks as though there is no chance
10k/wav/3913.wav|EN-US|EN| The reason is to do as the nature of the Scotland manager.
10k/wav/3924.wav|EN-US|EN| Business has never been so bad.
10k/wav/3926.wav|EN-US|EN| We have achieved that.
10k/wav/3935.wav|EN-US|EN| The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.
10k/wav/3936.wav|EN-US|EN| But this is just the first step.
10k/wav/3938.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the real thing for sure.
10k/wav/394.wav|EN-US|EN| Nata has left them with no other option.
10k/wav/3951.wav|EN-US|EN| We await a decision.
10k/wav/3966.wav|EN-US|EN| That's all we'll play to both sets of fans.
10k/wav/3969.wav|EN-US|EN| He is now resident in England.
10k/wav/3988.wav|EN-US|EN| I think he was nervous to begin with.
10k/wav/4008.wav|EN-US|EN| This is extremely positive news.
10k/wav/4035.wav|EN-US|EN| I was surprised by his response.
10k/wav/4036.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be great to you, Mist.
10k/wav/4043.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a very special moment for me.
10k/wav/4044.wav|EN-US|EN| It's time to say enough is enough.
10k/wav/4046.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not great, but it goes well.
10k/wav/4067.wav|EN-US|EN| The interim dividend has been passed.
10k/wav/4096.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the name of the game though.
10k/wav/4099.wav|EN-US|EN| We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
10k/wav/4105.wav|EN-US|EN| Anyone can take a photo.
10k/wav/4115.wav|EN-US|EN| We hope he will do until he finally does the job well.
10k/wav/4120.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish life can be like this too.
10k/wav/4158.wav|EN-US|EN| There are a few changes
10k/wav/4160.wav|EN-US|EN| But what is?
10k/wav/4161.wav|EN-US|EN| He had a decision to make.
10k/wav/4168.wav|EN-US|EN| This was the perfect setting.
10k/wav/4172.wav|EN-US|EN| The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
10k/wav/4192.wav|EN-US|EN| The Mist Exciting Room is the final one of the show.
10k/wav/4193.wav|EN-US|EN| It is looking very special.
10k/wav/4196.wav|EN-US|EN| And we have a singer.
10k/wav/420.wav|EN-US|EN| Insurance will be covered by the receiving calories.
10k/wav/4202.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it very nearly all went wrong.
10k/wav/4213.wav|EN-US|EN| He is only nourishing his confidence.
10k/wav/4218.wav|EN-US|EN| We will turn the corner.
10k/wav/4223.wav|EN-US|EN| It is legally binding.
10k/wav/4229.wav|EN-US|EN| We speak about the performance.
10k/wav/426.wav|EN-US|EN| Each will need enjoyment is two ways.
10k/wav/428.wav|EN-US|EN| Five local people were injured.
10k/wav/4280.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the most important thing for me.
10k/wav/4283.wav|EN-US|EN| The observers saw no evidence of fighting.
10k/wav/429.wav|EN-US|EN| We were well worth the win.
10k/wav/4290.wav|EN-US|EN| The children continue to talk to us.
10k/wav/4314.wav|EN-US|EN| Why did it take a concerted campaign?
10k/wav/4320.wav|EN-US|EN| After this, they were always in the driving seat.
10k/wav/4323.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was the sensible thing to do.
10k/wav/4327.wav|EN-US|EN| They thought to set up there was an affair.
10k/wav/434.wav|EN-US|EN| It is really good news.
10k/wav/4357.wav|EN-US|EN| I am working on that one too.
10k/wav/4362.wav|EN-US|EN| According to the criteria he is qualified for Scotland.
10k/wav/4375.wav|EN-US|EN| We do not get that impression there.
10k/wav/4378.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to handle it.
10k/wav/4385.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly it is very disturbing.
10k/wav/4386.wav|EN-US|EN| William said the same.
10k/wav/4403.wav|EN-US|EN| It was bound to happen.
10k/wav/442.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a long process, but we got there.
10k/wav/4432.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very very difficult for me to look at this.
10k/wav/4434.wav|EN-US|EN| That will be the case.
10k/wav/4446.wav|EN-US|EN| I can hardly believe it.
10k/wav/4462.wav|EN-US|EN| The defender made an impressive debut.
10k/wav/4468.wav|EN-US|EN| And we've beaten them before.
10k/wav/4472.wav|EN-US|EN| We will work through the night.
10k/wav/4476.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the same as Glasgow
10k/wav/4479.wav|EN-US|EN| The latter is due to be finished in February.
10k/wav/4489.wav|EN-US|EN| Other control freaks.
10k/wav/4516.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't have to be an infamous.
10k/wav/4533.wav|EN-US|EN| Our members are concerned about their futures.
10k/wav/4541.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a total surprise.
10k/wav/4545.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to respect the office.
10k/wav/4550.wav|EN-US|EN| Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
10k/wav/4570.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the crunch.
10k/wav/4583.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the lesson of the last 3 weeks.
10k/wav/459.wav|EN-US|EN| An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
10k/wav/4596.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know how they do it.
10k/wav/4599.wav|EN-US|EN| We will have to see, but it makes you think.
10k/wav/46.wav|EN-US|EN| It is back to how it used to be.
10k/wav/4609.wav|EN-US|EN| He has a lot of experience as a captain in his grey.
10k/wav/4612.wav|EN-US|EN| The objective was achieved.
10k/wav/462.wav|EN-US|EN| I fell in love with it.
10k/wav/4644.wav|EN-US|EN| It's quite nice.
10k/wav/4660.wav|EN-US|EN| It gets too much.
10k/wav/4663.wav|EN-US|EN| This towing is critical for New Zealand Drop B.
10k/wav/4675.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
10k/wav/4679.wav|EN-US|EN| It is turning that way I will cross Europe
10k/wav/4684.wav|EN-US|EN| I can't wait to meet him.
10k/wav/4689.wav|EN-US|EN| Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
10k/wav/4702.wav|EN-US|EN| She can scoot these things into three red bags and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
10k/wav/4723.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't believe we didn't when that came.
10k/wav/4724.wav|EN-US|EN| The knees is not all bad.
10k/wav/473.wav|EN-US|EN| Here was an anti-supporting the bill
10k/wav/4736.wav|EN-US|EN| That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
10k/wav/4743.wav|EN-US|EN| We discovered that for ourselves.
10k/wav/4752.wav|EN-US|EN| Overall, we are very pleased
10k/wav/4754.wav|EN-US|EN| For me, any manager is good.
10k/wav/4756.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very special place.
10k/wav/4777.wav|EN-US|EN| Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
10k/wav/48.wav|EN-US|EN| He is not exactly a pretty child.
10k/wav/4812.wav|EN-US|EN| Our task is to complete the picture.
10k/wav/4816.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Irvine said Mr. Rafferty was 9 good spirits.
10k/wav/4836.wav|EN-US|EN| It's set in the upward that way.
10k/wav/4863.wav|EN-US|EN| Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
10k/wav/4870.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time for new ways from the church.
10k/wav/4876.wav|EN-US|EN| She makes me feel very proud.
10k/wav/4890.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a private matter between the thumb and our stuff.
10k/wav/4906.wav|EN-US|EN| They are difficult towards to decide.
10k/wav/4914.wav|EN-US|EN| All films open tomorrow.
10k/wav/4921.wav|EN-US|EN| But was it really so big?
10k/wav/4942.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been very difficult.
10k/wav/4945.wav|EN-US|EN| Failure is not an option.
10k/wav/495.wav|EN-US|EN| Self-control is just one installment.
10k/wav/4984.wav|EN-US|EN| Cheniary is a bad time of year.
10k/wav/4995.wav|EN-US|EN| They have nowhere else to go.
10k/wav/5009.wav|EN-US|EN| It was another good idea.
10k/wav/5013.wav|EN-US|EN| Seven children had lost both parents.
10k/wav/5017.wav|EN-US|EN| From there, they can go anyone.
10k/wav/5021.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by Franz Telekom.
10k/wav/5022.wav|EN-US|EN| Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
10k/wav/5024.wav|EN-US|EN| They tried to give her advice.
10k/wav/5027.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland will finish the group in second place.
10k/wav/5034.wav|EN-US|EN| Whits were not too quiet.
10k/wav/5049.wav|EN-US|EN| He was happy. The BBC was happy. The listeners were happy.
10k/wav/5061.wav|EN-US|EN| Though he goes again.
10k/wav/5067.wav|EN-US|EN| We are confident of taking that back.
10k/wav/5068.wav|EN-US|EN| That is really all.
10k/wav/5078.wav|EN-US|EN| I think Kamev would create a lot of interest.
10k/wav/51.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a plan in place.
10k/wav/5115.wav|EN-US|EN| As I'm not talking about his career.
10k/wav/5127.wav|EN-US|EN| This is important for two reasons.
10k/wav/5142.wav|EN-US|EN| That is very very bad news for our nation.
10k/wav/5150.wav|EN-US|EN| Mist of them were one of your conscripts.
10k/wav/5151.wav|EN-US|EN| There are some philosophical issues involved.
10k/wav/5156.wav|EN-US|EN| The font has three elements.
10k/wav/5162.wav|EN-US|EN| What is going on?
10k/wav/5164.wav|EN-US|EN| Cousins see the point.
10k/wav/5174.wav|EN-US|EN| The amount of energy in the tornado is enormous.
10k/wav/518.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no trouble at all.
10k/wav/5186.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a moment of madness.
10k/wav/52.wav|EN-US|EN| We must get the three points.
10k/wav/5205.wav|EN-US|EN| The surprise is this product is so cool.
10k/wav/5206.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all in the hair.
10k/wav/5236.wav|EN-US|EN| What will happen to them, ma'am?
10k/wav/5256.wav|EN-US|EN| Also the theory goes
10k/wav/5261.wav|EN-US|EN| They will give it a couple of years.
10k/wav/5274.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a true story.
10k/wav/5275.wav|EN-US|EN| This time, however, may have been different
10k/wav/5279.wav|EN-US|EN| You can enter to one without the other.
10k/wav/528.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not going to make any further comment apart from that.
10k/wav/5283.wav|EN-US|EN| I sight at a ruck.
10k/wav/5300.wav|EN-US|EN| Since then he has played no active polter in the company.
10k/wav/5320.wav|EN-US|EN| We did not deserve to go through.
10k/wav/5331.wav|EN-US|EN| I want my mum.
10k/wav/5364.wav|EN-US|EN| The project has already secured the support of Séchamps Commie.
10k/wav/5367.wav|EN-US|EN| Sentence was deferred for background reports.
10k/wav/5369.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know exactly what happened.
10k/wav/5372.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a good signing for Rangers
10k/wav/5391.wav|EN-US|EN| She took them for time.
10k/wav/5394.wav|EN-US|EN| The government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
10k/wav/5401.wav|EN-US|EN| We can get back on track with that.
10k/wav/5445.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a horrific incident.
10k/wav/5453.wav|EN-US|EN| It would make a lot of sense.
10k/wav/5454.wav|EN-US|EN| Five officers were injured.
10k/wav/5473.wav|EN-US|EN| Who would be right?
10k/wav/5487.wav|EN-US|EN| Some of their movement was excellent.
10k/wav/5497.wav|EN-US|EN| But he is not hopeful.
10k/wav/551.wav|EN-US|EN| There are plenty of examples
10k/wav/5517.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not have faith in the procedures.
10k/wav/552.wav|EN-US|EN| The dangers are very obvious.
10k/wav/5535.wav|EN-US|EN| The truth of course is very different.
10k/wav/5541.wav|EN-US|EN| It came a bit late.
10k/wav/5548.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not the most crucial issue.
10k/wav/5555.wav|EN-US|EN| Players are fighting to stay in the team.
10k/wav/5570.wav|EN-US|EN| She died at home.
10k/wav/5584.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a definite proposal as yet.
10k/wav/5589.wav|EN-US|EN| Already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
10k/wav/5594.wav|EN-US|EN| That statement has never been withdrawn.
10k/wav/5595.wav|EN-US|EN| Until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
10k/wav/560.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there are signs of dissentum on his colleagues.
10k/wav/5603.wav|EN-US|EN| It sounds a bit of an end goal.
10k/wav/5610.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we did well.
10k/wav/5613.wav|EN-US|EN| Who will take them after that?
10k/wav/5626.wav|EN-US|EN| Six of the asylum seekers left the officers, it was reported.
10k/wav/5658.wav|EN-US|EN| We are looking to the future.
10k/wav/5682.wav|EN-US|EN| Again we were lucky.
10k/wav/57.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the way it looks.
10k/wav/5707.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no such thing.
10k/wav/5710.wav|EN-US|EN| It always is on general release.
10k/wav/5716.wav|EN-US|EN| I soften as not, the course remains a mystery.
10k/wav/572.wav|EN-US|EN| Let the voters decide
10k/wav/5724.wav|EN-US|EN| This sky is amazing.
10k/wav/5749.wav|EN-US|EN| Ivy cut the same filling as I had last week in Germany
10k/wav/5750.wav|EN-US|EN| Who wants to be a Molino?
10k/wav/5768.wav|EN-US|EN| And we are doing it.
10k/wav/5797.wav|EN-US|EN| What do they do anyway?
10k/wav/5798.wav|EN-US|EN| We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
10k/wav/5812.wav|EN-US|EN| These take the shape of a long round arc with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
10k/wav/5821.wav|EN-US|EN| If they don't they can expect their funding to be cut.
10k/wav/5824.wav|EN-US|EN| I was on the pitch and everything.
10k/wav/5858.wav|EN-US|EN| I was as strong as a horse.
10k/wav/5859.wav|EN-US|EN| First meeting was next week.
10k/wav/586.wav|EN-US|EN| He just asked to win.
10k/wav/5862.wav|EN-US|EN| Could it have been better spent?
10k/wav/5869.wav|EN-US|EN| It is worse because she suffers from angina.
10k/wav/587.wav|EN-US|EN| He said something in his work.
10k/wav/5882.wav|EN-US|EN| You just have to get on with it.
10k/wav/5884.wav|EN-US|EN| Find them somebody they deserve.
10k/wav/5888.wav|EN-US|EN| Shim was down there with his wife
10k/wav/5892.wav|EN-US|EN| It's much more dynamic.
10k/wav/5893.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a definite prejudice
10k/wav/5896.wav|EN-US|EN| Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow
10k/wav/5909.wav|EN-US|EN| I said how much.
10k/wav/5925.wav|EN-US|EN| The package was expected to be launched within the next two months.
10k/wav/5942.wav|EN-US|EN| And that is about it.
10k/wav/5948.wav|EN-US|EN| It looks as though the issue with the Scotsman is too sensitive.
10k/wav/5967.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing has been put into action.
10k/wav/5973.wav|EN-US|EN| There is still the question of his health.
10k/wav/5976.wav|EN-US|EN| She's the spy.
10k/wav/5981.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a mixture of everything.
10k/wav/5988.wav|EN-US|EN| He should be careful.
10k/wav/599.wav|EN-US|EN| Just what we didn't need.
10k/wav/5991.wav|EN-US|EN| We are now for Ken's tit.
10k/wav/6.wav|EN-US|EN| We have come a long way since then.
10k/wav/6003.wav|EN-US|EN| How can we ignore it?
10k/wav/6010.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a chop to be done.
10k/wav/6023.wav|EN-US|EN| A foreign office spokesman declined to comment.
10k/wav/6048.wav|EN-US|EN| He was on a mission.
10k/wav/6049.wav|EN-US|EN| Feather expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
10k/wav/6050.wav|EN-US|EN| He lives in a neighboring village.
10k/wav/6052.wav|EN-US|EN| There were other problems for Brian yesterday.
10k/wav/6054.wav|EN-US|EN| The surface will only survive with change.
10k/wav/6062.wav|EN-US|EN| But he insisted that victory was possible.
10k/wav/6075.wav|EN-US|EN| He was at the outset of his career.
10k/wav/6076.wav|EN-US|EN| We do not expect any surplus.
10k/wav/6077.wav|EN-US|EN| Her heart was not in it.
10k/wav/6078.wav|EN-US|EN| I had several wits when the fourth official and was warned.
10k/wav/6083.wav|EN-US|EN| The move follows a review of the Singapore.
10k/wav/6089.wav|EN-US|EN| You should be.
10k/wav/6096.wav|EN-US|EN| We beat the watch team.
10k/wav/610.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted for everyone that's telling.
10k/wav/6102.wav|EN-US|EN| He is that good.
10k/wav/6105.wav|EN-US|EN| Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
10k/wav/6111.wav|EN-US|EN| The opposite is the case.
10k/wav/612.wav|EN-US|EN| Now we must look to the future.
10k/wav/6134.wav|EN-US|EN| I intend the highest standards
10k/wav/6135.wav|EN-US|EN| He added we are full of anger
10k/wav/6137.wav|EN-US|EN| Things are meant to be.
10k/wav/6142.wav|EN-US|EN| but they will be less attractive than that
10k/wav/6148.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm here to play football.
10k/wav/6150.wav|EN-US|EN| I suspect the latter.
10k/wav/6154.wav|EN-US|EN| Classes must be reduced by half.
10k/wav/6160.wav|EN-US|EN| She looked very startled.
10k/wav/6174.wav|EN-US|EN| I never had a childhood.
10k/wav/618.wav|EN-US|EN| No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
10k/wav/6180.wav|EN-US|EN| Does the name matter?
10k/wav/6194.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot believe that is the way format.
10k/wav/6196.wav|EN-US|EN| After that, it's a step into the unknown.
10k/wav/6205.wav|EN-US|EN| This decision is destroying my family.
10k/wav/6211.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland will be an integral part of Aboriginal
10k/wav/6223.wav|EN-US|EN| He told a producer.
10k/wav/6231.wav|EN-US|EN| I was a little surprised.
10k/wav/6234.wav|EN-US|EN| It would appear to be a good time to invest
10k/wav/624.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it is a sensible change.
10k/wav/625.wav|EN-US|EN| You seem to pose then, Sean.
10k/wav/6267.wav|EN-US|EN| His record on government has always been highly effective.
10k/wav/6269.wav|EN-US|EN| If they don't, they won't get what they want.
10k/wav/6271.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not just going to be busy.
10k/wav/6282.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very very confident.
10k/wav/6285.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a crucial award.
10k/wav/6291.wav|EN-US|EN| Final proposals will be published in February.
10k/wav/6309.wav|EN-US|EN| That period was a struggle.
10k/wav/6310.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not truly used by many people.
10k/wav/6313.wav|EN-US|EN| A copy of the report will be sent to them.
10k/wav/6316.wav|EN-US|EN| Something has to be done.
10k/wav/634.wav|EN-US|EN| There's three goals in five minutes change of the game.
10k/wav/6343.wav|EN-US|EN| I agree with you about this.
10k/wav/6344.wav|EN-US|EN| He has a punt.
10k/wav/6365.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not disputed that the driver was upfought.
10k/wav/6367.wav|EN-US|EN| No one from the Fibrocates union was available for comment yesterday.
10k/wav/6381.wav|EN-US|EN| She said he should know remorse.
10k/wav/6387.wav|EN-US|EN| This was another video cassette.
10k/wav/641.wav|EN-US|EN| Children are using books in a terrible condition.
10k/wav/6410.wav|EN-US|EN| Wish I could be there on Sunday in person, but I can't.
10k/wav/6413.wav|EN-US|EN| It was inter-conscious decision not to shout.
10k/wav/6414.wav|EN-US|EN| I've had to take time off work today.
10k/wav/6415.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought they played well.
10k/wav/6421.wav|EN-US|EN| People should not become complacent.
10k/wav/6431.wav|EN-US|EN| I am a soldier, soldier, a soldier.
10k/wav/6435.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, it does not end there.
10k/wav/6437.wav|EN-US|EN| He could still be president.
10k/wav/6450.wav|EN-US|EN| Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
10k/wav/6455.wav|EN-US|EN| And our game is about going forward.
10k/wav/6458.wav|EN-US|EN| We don't know what happened.
10k/wav/6475.wav|EN-US|EN| We just wish they had done so before.
10k/wav/65.wav|EN-US|EN| The walk was a lifeline for me.
10k/wav/6524.wav|EN-US|EN| That was really tough.
10k/wav/6529.wav|EN-US|EN| Then the answer is a public inquiry.
10k/wav/6530.wav|EN-US|EN| We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
10k/wav/6540.wav|EN-US|EN| Almost overnight, he found his face.
10k/wav/6548.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was money well spent.
10k/wav/6556.wav|EN-US|EN| We operate as a Scottish company.
10k/wav/656.wav|EN-US|EN| This was an option from the beginning.
10k/wav/6573.wav|EN-US|EN| But then he changed his mind.
10k/wav/6586.wav|EN-US|EN| Any art is severely punished
10k/wav/6597.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been a humbling year.
10k/wav/6602.wav|EN-US|EN| We will have to be satisfied with it.
10k/wav/6612.wav|EN-US|EN| Petition is not an option.
10k/wav/6620.wav|EN-US|EN| That time has passed.
10k/wav/6624.wav|EN-US|EN| He announced his plans.
10k/wav/6634.wav|EN-US|EN| She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
10k/wav/6636.wav|EN-US|EN| George Mitchell is trying to close the cup.
10k/wav/6641.wav|EN-US|EN| What a weak he has had!
10k/wav/6644.wav|EN-US|EN| I have great respect for my players.
10k/wav/6649.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
10k/wav/6650.wav|EN-US|EN| But he not relearn it.
10k/wav/6671.wav|EN-US|EN| They could not match it.
10k/wav/6675.wav|EN-US|EN| We though very unhappy about it.
10k/wav/6678.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought he was an animal.
10k/wav/668.wav|EN-US|EN| It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
10k/wav/6683.wav|EN-US|EN| You were very proud of that date to be among their friends.
10k/wav/6695.wav|EN-US|EN| His figures are truly terrible.
10k/wav/6705.wav|EN-US|EN| He had come of it.
10k/wav/6712.wav|EN-US|EN| Why did they let him go?
10k/wav/6714.wav|EN-US|EN| This was great for our sport.
10k/wav/6719.wav|EN-US|EN| Again, it's about responding to your resources.
10k/wav/6733.wav|EN-US|EN| The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
10k/wav/6741.wav|EN-US|EN| It ended as it began, in confusion.
10k/wav/6744.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to sort it out ourselves.
10k/wav/6749.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no grants for his action.
10k/wav/6757.wav|EN-US|EN| This game is very evenly balanced.
10k/wav/6762.wav|EN-US|EN| He had just returned from a run.
10k/wav/6764.wav|EN-US|EN| Here we go again.
10k/wav/679.wav|EN-US|EN| In my view, it has to be done
10k/wav/6797.wav|EN-US|EN| I asked why he had come.
10k/wav/681.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be difficult to replace.
10k/wav/6821.wav|EN-US|EN| Winning costs are not subsided by public money.
10k/wav/6827.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the story of the second tough.
10k/wav/6848.wav|EN-US|EN| What is the truth about the car?
10k/wav/685.wav|EN-US|EN| It still has an effect.
10k/wav/6853.wav|EN-US|EN| This is very disturbing news.
10k/wav/6857.wav|EN-US|EN| We are making no comment
10k/wav/6859.wav|EN-US|EN| It all depends on the wind.
10k/wav/6870.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it is wide open.
10k/wav/6871.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to offer value for money.
10k/wav/6877.wav|EN-US|EN| One thing is set in
10k/wav/6882.wav|EN-US|EN| How could anyone take issue with that?
10k/wav/6886.wav|EN-US|EN| We are ticket seriously.
10k/wav/6891.wav|EN-US|EN| Their ambition is to go back.
10k/wav/6926.wav|EN-US|EN| We are asking the council to think again.
10k/wav/693.wav|EN-US|EN| But honestly there is no need for us to panic.
10k/wav/6932.wav|EN-US|EN| Chelsea was a great club.
10k/wav/6940.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm quite excited about it.
10k/wav/6949.wav|EN-US|EN| They will do something big.
10k/wav/6967.wav|EN-US|EN| We did it for the jersey.
10k/wav/6974.wav|EN-US|EN| After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
10k/wav/6985.wav|EN-US|EN| You cannot eat in the dining room.
10k/wav/7003.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is the logic in that?
10k/wav/7005.wav|EN-US|EN| None has ever been found.
10k/wav/7013.wav|EN-US|EN| It can help.
10k/wav/7020.wav|EN-US|EN| We are all equal.
10k/wav/7023.wav|EN-US|EN| The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
10k/wav/7029.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to move away from the culture of Longmas.
10k/wav/7057.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
10k/wav/7076.wav|EN-US|EN| I am delighted with our performance.
10k/wav/708.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't bother so.
10k/wav/7092.wav|EN-US|EN| I still feel like a weeboo.
10k/wav/7095.wav|EN-US|EN| Some of the plays have not progressed.
10k/wav/7096.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is the discipline?
10k/wav/7098.wav|EN-US|EN| We will seek knowledge to grief and pain of their relatives.
10k/wav/7102.wav|EN-US|EN| This will provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.
10k/wav/711.wav|EN-US|EN| I am pleased with some aspects of the performance.
10k/wav/7111.wav|EN-US|EN| I read about it in the newspapers.
10k/wav/7113.wav|EN-US|EN| It just came into my head that day.
10k/wav/7121.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a neathal.
10k/wav/7145.wav|EN-US|EN| The market is the market.
10k/wav/7152.wav|EN-US|EN| the folding like the principal provisions.
10k/wav/7169.wav|EN-US|EN| Two people went to Vute.
10k/wav/717.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no need to panic.
10k/wav/7184.wav|EN-US|EN| I recommend it too.
10k/wav/7195.wav|EN-US|EN| It also makes a habit of collecting people.
10k/wav/7218.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a classic.
10k/wav/7238.wav|EN-US|EN| Both of thus promises have already been hunted.
10k/wav/725.wav|EN-US|EN| They've been wonderful to me.
10k/wav/7272.wav|EN-US|EN| What has changed?
10k/wav/7280.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just appalling luck.
10k/wav/7293.wav|EN-US|EN| So though, we won.
10k/wav/7294.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you mint a day?
10k/wav/7297.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a good win for us.
10k/wav/7300.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought it was quite good.
10k/wav/7316.wav|EN-US|EN| They did too, but it didn't matter by then.
10k/wav/732.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm an actor.
10k/wav/7331.wav|EN-US|EN| He added, it's not a racial problem.
10k/wav/7333.wav|EN-US|EN| NATO will prevail.
10k/wav/735.wav|EN-US|EN| We could feel the heat.
10k/wav/7351.wav|EN-US|EN| Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
10k/wav/7366.wav|EN-US|EN| Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
10k/wav/7369.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a family tragedy.
10k/wav/737.wav|EN-US|EN| But I was not up for the title.
10k/wav/738.wav|EN-US|EN| It will now be revived.
10k/wav/7397.wav|EN-US|EN| This election is far from over.
10k/wav/7434.wav|EN-US|EN| It is surprising to come back this way.
10k/wav/7444.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish life was there over one year.
10k/wav/7446.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been done from the Samanin.
10k/wav/7456.wav|EN-US|EN| Today's ruling confirms that fact.
10k/wav/7472.wav|EN-US|EN| Meanwhile, angels will continue to search for a striker.
10k/wav/7488.wav|EN-US|EN| The teacher would have approved.
10k/wav/7490.wav|EN-US|EN| We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
10k/wav/7491.wav|EN-US|EN| when we looked out the company.
10k/wav/750.wav|EN-US|EN| Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
10k/wav/7512.wav|EN-US|EN| I am going to Baikou
10k/wav/7521.wav|EN-US|EN| And you need to be so resourceful.
10k/wav/7528.wav|EN-US|EN| It's always a dilemma.
10k/wav/7531.wav|EN-US|EN| There was even a jerk.
10k/wav/7533.wav|EN-US|EN| They will fight for everything.
10k/wav/7543.wav|EN-US|EN| It does not move which is amazing.
10k/wav/757.wav|EN-US|EN| He is to be commended.
10k/wav/7582.wav|EN-US|EN| I just hope it's not tonight against us.
10k/wav/7599.wav|EN-US|EN| He can make it.
10k/wav/7609.wav|EN-US|EN| This will have to change.
10k/wav/7613.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt about this big.
10k/wav/7618.wav|EN-US|EN| I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
10k/wav/7629.wav|EN-US|EN| We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
10k/wav/7631.wav|EN-US|EN| Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
10k/wav/7637.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland will play its part.
10k/wav/7642.wav|EN-US|EN| It's to do with context.
10k/wav/7647.wav|EN-US|EN| We are in this for the long call.
10k/wav/7666.wav|EN-US|EN| We have still got the fight in us.
10k/wav/7668.wav|EN-US|EN| They had to explain it.
10k/wav/7672.wav|EN-US|EN| Kolf is a game of Hanover and ethics.
10k/wav/7678.wav|EN-US|EN| Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
10k/wav/7681.wav|EN-US|EN| We'll cut his last couple of records.
10k/wav/7685.wav|EN-US|EN| Our performance wasn't perfect.
10k/wav/7702.wav|EN-US|EN| He also seems to have been armed forever.
10k/wav/7713.wav|EN-US|EN| David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
10k/wav/7714.wav|EN-US|EN| It had a gigantic effect.
10k/wav/7724.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the ear of the tiger.
10k/wav/7745.wav|EN-US|EN| It sounded awfully like panic.
10k/wav/7748.wav|EN-US|EN| I was ready for this.
10k/wav/7755.wav|EN-US|EN| The pain was almost too much to bear.
10k/wav/7768.wav|EN-US|EN| He loved his children.
10k/wav/7769.wav|EN-US|EN| It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
10k/wav/779.wav|EN-US|EN| I might also completely change the routine.
10k/wav/7798.wav|EN-US|EN| He got his degree.
10k/wav/7803.wav|EN-US|EN| But he will do anything.
10k/wav/7806.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we are back on track.
10k/wav/7812.wav|EN-US|EN| Is it worth it?
10k/wav/7827.wav|EN-US|EN| Working is certainly the best.
10k/wav/7842.wav|EN-US|EN| I approach will be different.
10k/wav/7845.wav|EN-US|EN| Progress is being made but it is slow.
10k/wav/7846.wav|EN-US|EN| He is wanted by Chairman Police for questioning.
10k/wav/7849.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
10k/wav/786.wav|EN-US|EN| It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
10k/wav/7878.wav|EN-US|EN| But the action is about to be restarted.
10k/wav/7887.wav|EN-US|EN| I can tell you Leibar is fighting to win.
10k/wav/7891.wav|EN-US|EN| Councillor Cordon has refused to stand down.
10k/wav/7918.wav|EN-US|EN| Chevalier can't run for two years.
10k/wav/793.wav|EN-US|EN| Yet it is all for two good causes.
10k/wav/7947.wav|EN-US|EN| On Saturday it was much the same.
10k/wav/7950.wav|EN-US|EN| I also had a lot of injuries which did not help me.
10k/wav/7952.wav|EN-US|EN| Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old
10k/wav/7977.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not going to blame the band.
10k/wav/7984.wav|EN-US|EN| This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
10k/wav/7996.wav|EN-US|EN| It is business as usual.
10k/wav/7999.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the worst of both worlds.
10k/wav/8.wav|EN-US|EN| Some people still think she should be English.
10k/wav/8006.wav|EN-US|EN| The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
10k/wav/8007.wav|EN-US|EN| We are entirely happy with Russell.
10k/wav/801.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got good options.
10k/wav/8023.wav|EN-US|EN| Her body has never been found.
10k/wav/8027.wav|EN-US|EN| Next year this time we will be home.
10k/wav/8033.wav|EN-US|EN| We've just had it confirmed.
10k/wav/8038.wav|EN-US|EN| Not many people like to do that.
10k/wav/804.wav|EN-US|EN| Naturally, she said yes.
10k/wav/8044.wav|EN-US|EN| We live in shorthand.
10k/wav/8048.wav|EN-US|EN| Anything that can be done, the government will do.
10k/wav/8055.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted to hear this news.
10k/wav/8083.wav|EN-US|EN| It works for us.
10k/wav/809.wav|EN-US|EN| If they have city backing, what is their influence?
10k/wav/81.wav|EN-US|EN| In the end we have to take a stand.
10k/wav/8100.wav|EN-US|EN| We wanted to sort it out.
10k/wav/8101.wav|EN-US|EN| This is still happening in the US
10k/wav/8102.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't believe in gesture politics.
10k/wav/8108.wav|EN-US|EN| It didn't get any better.
10k/wav/811.wav|EN-US|EN| However the referee was not in the giving then.
10k/wav/8124.wav|EN-US|EN| I was just a kid.
10k/wav/8132.wav|EN-US|EN| It also highlighted some local heritage districts.
10k/wav/8136.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just that we see different things.
10k/wav/8138.wav|EN-US|EN| My life is coming over at the weekend.
10k/wav/814.wav|EN-US|EN| Tyson said he had made a mistake.
10k/wav/8140.wav|EN-US|EN| He declined to give further details.
10k/wav/8145.wav|EN-US|EN| But does the same thing happen with music?
10k/wav/816.wav|EN-US|EN| It certainly is cause for concern.
10k/wav/8160.wav|EN-US|EN| They wanted to share what they could do.
10k/wav/8162.wav|EN-US|EN| The joy is still out.
10k/wav/8170.wav|EN-US|EN| He deserved that much.
10k/wav/8171.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
10k/wav/8178.wav|EN-US|EN| It rocked, up to a point.
10k/wav/818.wav|EN-US|EN| Do they have to create 7 majors?
10k/wav/8186.wav|EN-US|EN| Little managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
10k/wav/8214.wav|EN-US|EN| Then again, we could have
10k/wav/8221.wav|EN-US|EN| The referee had been right.
10k/wav/8236.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just not funny.
10k/wav/8241.wav|EN-US|EN| Look, George W. Pasupus will come here in two months.
10k/wav/8257.wav|EN-US|EN| Normally, they have been a puck of lies.
10k/wav/8279.wav|EN-US|EN| It's good to start with Judith.
10k/wav/8283.wav|EN-US|EN| They will now remain split up
10k/wav/8304.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems a good thing to try.
10k/wav/8310.wav|EN-US|EN| The peel is impartial.
10k/wav/8315.wav|EN-US|EN| Which is found off?
10k/wav/8316.wav|EN-US|EN| There's still much work to be done.
10k/wav/8327.wav|EN-US|EN| There is bound to be a formal complaint.
10k/wav/8340.wav|EN-US|EN| It must never be seen as second class.
10k/wav/8350.wav|EN-US|EN| The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
10k/wav/8358.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a kind of love if that was Hollywood.
10k/wav/8368.wav|EN-US|EN| They were later released and last night was staying with relatives.
10k/wav/8369.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to foy.
10k/wav/8383.wav|EN-US|EN| Some realism was needed about the time of resources and management.
10k/wav/8393.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a sensitive issue.
10k/wav/840.wav|EN-US|EN| Like everything in Scotland, it takes time
10k/wav/841.wav|EN-US|EN| They will probably come back.
10k/wav/8413.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither of them was badly hurt.
10k/wav/8427.wav|EN-US|EN| That was always the danger.
10k/wav/8431.wav|EN-US|EN| We were extremely arrogant.
10k/wav/8438.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not even allowed to see him.
10k/wav/8466.wav|EN-US|EN| That is how we will be judged.
10k/wav/8467.wav|EN-US|EN| I look for dancers who are also actors.
10k/wav/8471.wav|EN-US|EN| There are so many buildings in there.
10k/wav/8492.wav|EN-US|EN| But the Ranley was sought alive.
10k/wav/8495.wav|EN-US|EN| It is truly a master lead performance.
10k/wav/8496.wav|EN-US|EN| People must remain vigilant.
10k/wav/8499.wav|EN-US|EN| It really is tremendous.
10k/wav/8506.wav|EN-US|EN| We have not reached the point of no return.
10k/wav/8508.wav|EN-US|EN| Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
10k/wav/852.wav|EN-US|EN| That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
10k/wav/8530.wav|EN-US|EN| Dancing was her life.
10k/wav/8544.wav|EN-US|EN| This is very bad news.
10k/wav/8547.wav|EN-US|EN| My back is feeling really good.
10k/wav/856.wav|EN-US|EN| But we need to keep it there.
10k/wav/8573.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't let me down.
10k/wav/8575.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw people on fire.
10k/wav/8577.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all changed in Killmonic.
10k/wav/8589.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no right to appeal.
10k/wav/8594.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the same old story.
10k/wav/8606.wav|EN-US|EN| Olsen is not convinced.
10k/wav/8642.wav|EN-US|EN| We would expect it to disappear in time.
10k/wav/8662.wav|EN-US|EN| So far the weather has been very pleasant.
10k/wav/8666.wav|EN-US|EN| WebView has now completely changed.
10k/wav/8684.wav|EN-US|EN| Libby is an easy target.
10k/wav/8704.wav|EN-US|EN| The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
10k/wav/8716.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's such a process.
10k/wav/8719.wav|EN-US|EN| He deserves the top team.
10k/wav/8725.wav|EN-US|EN| Any increase always has some effect.
10k/wav/8745.wav|EN-US|EN| That was not the norm.
10k/wav/8746.wav|EN-US|EN| You are a lie
10k/wav/8760.wav|EN-US|EN| Or have they?
10k/wav/8762.wav|EN-US|EN| What's the bit to do?
10k/wav/8793.wav|EN-US|EN| It would seem a nutshell progression.
10k/wav/8810.wav|EN-US|EN| However, that is a sizeable if
10k/wav/8837.wav|EN-US|EN| Its effect on humans is not yet known.
10k/wav/8846.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a huge confidence boost.
10k/wav/8847.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to celebrate the World Cup.
10k/wav/8849.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a lovely, lovely film.
10k/wav/8854.wav|EN-US|EN| You will need it.
10k/wav/8874.wav|EN-US|EN| It's always hard to be about the gym.
10k/wav/888.wav|EN-US|EN| Our family, Health Hand Golf is always a balancing act.
10k/wav/8887.wav|EN-US|EN| The story was being repeated across Scotland.
10k/wav/8890.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be new memories.
10k/wav/8892.wav|EN-US|EN| He has a real potential.
10k/wav/8909.wav|EN-US|EN| She would love it.
10k/wav/8911.wav|EN-US|EN| He completely loses control.
10k/wav/8919.wav|EN-US|EN| But what took them so long?
10k/wav/8921.wav|EN-US|EN| You need a resin for stone.
10k/wav/8925.wav|EN-US|EN| He will go on the bench.
10k/wav/8927.wav|EN-US|EN| Who would have thought it?
10k/wav/8931.wav|EN-US|EN| He doesn't even know who he is.
10k/wav/8933.wav|EN-US|EN| There are moments of silence.
10k/wav/8936.wav|EN-US|EN| The trial continues today.
10k/wav/8945.wav|EN-US|EN| Their eyes, however, told a different story.
10k/wav/8966.wav|EN-US|EN| There is also the point.
10k/wav/897.wav|EN-US|EN| He sat down like the piano.
10k/wav/9022.wav|EN-US|EN| He intends to repeal the sentences.
10k/wav/9023.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been a lovely family occasion.
10k/wav/9024.wav|EN-US|EN| It was also live on Madeo 5.
10k/wav/9042.wav|EN-US|EN| We had our chances.
10k/wav/9053.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a stunning drive from John.
10k/wav/9056.wav|EN-US|EN| I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
10k/wav/9064.wav|EN-US|EN| The cause of the fire is not yet known.
10k/wav/9070.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, he can do it.
10k/wav/9086.wav|EN-US|EN| Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
10k/wav/9088.wav|EN-US|EN| Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
10k/wav/9091.wav|EN-US|EN| If only the acting profession was that simple.
10k/wav/9097.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm happy for her.
10k/wav/9098.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the figures tell a different story.
10k/wav/9101.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very simple. No one is forced to compete.
10k/wav/9113.wav|EN-US|EN| This is your country.
10k/wav/9117.wav|EN-US|EN| The fate of the rest is unknown.
10k/wav/9121.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it's possible that Dick can have influenced some Dutch players to go there.
10k/wav/9125.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not been named.
10k/wav/913.wav|EN-US|EN| This result has given me much food for thought.
10k/wav/9135.wav|EN-US|EN| In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed
10k/wav/917.wav|EN-US|EN| It makes no influence on the public.
10k/wav/9173.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like a football team.
10k/wav/9176.wav|EN-US|EN| The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
10k/wav/9182.wav|EN-US|EN| We are playing good football.
10k/wav/9195.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel no problem with what they said.
10k/wav/92.wav|EN-US|EN| He did that every night I was with him.
10k/wav/9202.wav|EN-US|EN| Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
10k/wav/9208.wav|EN-US|EN| He only played us in Tokala.
10k/wav/9215.wav|EN-US|EN| It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
10k/wav/9216.wav|EN-US|EN| The same trend showed up throughout proton.
10k/wav/922.wav|EN-US|EN| You go in there and do it.
10k/wav/9225.wav|EN-US|EN| She was married with one son.
10k/wav/924.wav|EN-US|EN| How well did they get home?
10k/wav/9241.wav|EN-US|EN| She will do for me.
10k/wav/9250.wav|EN-US|EN| It was created by genocide.
10k/wav/9255.wav|EN-US|EN| The men are very white.
10k/wav/9256.wav|EN-US|EN| No progress has been made.
10k/wav/9274.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been campaigning for change for years.
10k/wav/9286.wav|EN-US|EN| I found the course in Spain.
10k/wav/9316.wav|EN-US|EN| Who do these people think they are?
10k/wav/9337.wav|EN-US|EN| Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cop Final.
10k/wav/9339.wav|EN-US|EN| There's no reason for panic.
10k/wav/934.wav|EN-US|EN| We were extremely lucky.
10k/wav/9343.wav|EN-US|EN| He deserves a second chance.
10k/wav/9345.wav|EN-US|EN| Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
10k/wav/9364.wav|EN-US|EN| I had to win this race.
10k/wav/9373.wav|EN-US|EN| Already the children are not dying
10k/wav/9386.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a small amount of money.
10k/wav/94.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the old story.
10k/wav/9406.wav|EN-US|EN| Our children are our future.
10k/wav/9410.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland as a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
10k/wav/9420.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly it is a mess.
10k/wav/9437.wav|EN-US|EN| Watch and I will soon retreat.
10k/wav/9442.wav|EN-US|EN| It was on my mind a little bit.
10k/wav/9449.wav|EN-US|EN| And that was just for starters.
10k/wav/945.wav|EN-US|EN| The Taliban response was swift.
10k/wav/9454.wav|EN-US|EN| We are just being flooded.
10k/wav/9455.wav|EN-US|EN| He followed the tell-in-read.
10k/wav/9462.wav|EN-US|EN| We then shock
10k/wav/9469.wav|EN-US|EN| The show is sold out like the others in the run.
10k/wav/9480.wav|EN-US|EN| She thought she was going to die.
10k/wav/9505.wav|EN-US|EN| We have other options.
10k/wav/9508.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very hopeful that he will be cleared.
10k/wav/9516.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to learn lessons from that.
10k/wav/9525.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no battle with the Scots.
10k/wav/9533.wav|EN-US|EN| But we will learn from that.
10k/wav/9540.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, you might have a punt.
10k/wav/9543.wav|EN-US|EN| Pist offices are closing now
10k/wav/9545.wav|EN-US|EN| That approach has passed itself by date.
10k/wav/9554.wav|EN-US|EN| Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.
10k/wav/956.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a separate announcement which is in a different leak.
10k/wav/9567.wav|EN-US|EN| She's going to enforce the care.
10k/wav/9572.wav|EN-US|EN| Manchester United are the Karthik example.
10k/wav/9573.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a national crisis.
10k/wav/9625.wav|EN-US|EN| Many other Scottish locations also feature.
10k/wav/963.wav|EN-US|EN| It is closed to call.
10k/wav/9646.wav|EN-US|EN| Above all the aggression must be stopped.
10k/wav/9649.wav|EN-US|EN| He will never walk the streets again.
10k/wav/9659.wav|EN-US|EN| At the election we will oppose the array.
10k/wav/9672.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought we were fantastic.
10k/wav/9677.wav|EN-US|EN| Now there's the salt.
10k/wav/9678.wav|EN-US|EN| People are determined to get it right.
10k/wav/968.wav|EN-US|EN| Sir, there is a double whammy.
10k/wav/9691.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought the race was a little bit slow.
10k/wav/9695.wav|EN-US|EN| Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
10k/wav/9715.wav|EN-US|EN| That decision is now being appealed.
10k/wav/9727.wav|EN-US|EN| Morton was delighted with his successes.
10k/wav/9732.wav|EN-US|EN| The danger is always there.
10k/wav/9738.wav|EN-US|EN| Well that's very new labour, isn't it?
10k/wav/9746.wav|EN-US|EN| He can win every week.
10k/wav/976.wav|EN-US|EN| I'll kill you, please. They have already done it.
10k/wav/9781.wav|EN-US|EN| It will not be a long campaign.
10k/wav/9804.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to help other women.
10k/wav/9807.wav|EN-US|EN| She was my big sister.
10k/wav/9813.wav|EN-US|EN| They could use the boost.
10k/wav/9817.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no way back fully knighted after that.
10k/wav/9822.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been owed you how it works.
10k/wav/9828.wav|EN-US|EN| Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around
10k/wav/9839.wav|EN-US|EN| Our customers come first.
10k/wav/9854.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a hugely popular decision.
10k/wav/9873.wav|EN-US|EN| Child is not a project.
10k/wav/9874.wav|EN-US|EN| Pearl isn't a decision for me.
10k/wav/9894.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very happy to be here.
10k/wav/9904.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never seen them down there.
10k/wav/9905.wav|EN-US|EN| For these people the ruling is very welcome.
10k/wav/9917.wav|EN-US|EN| We control every part of your life.
10k/wav/992.wav|EN-US|EN| These people were my friends.
10k/wav/9924.wav|EN-US|EN| We should have gone solo.
10k/wav/9925.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
10k/wav/9926.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not just in Edinburgh.
10k/wav/993.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not there yet.
10k/wav/9935.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a drug addict.
10k/wav/9943.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a pre-emptive strike.
10k/wav/9952.wav|EN-US|EN| What was all that about?
10k/wav/9960.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish I could see it again.
10k/wav/9991.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems to have been an angle.
10k/wav/1011.wav|EN-US|EN| Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
10k/wav/1012.wav|EN-US|EN| Many of them were his friends and koiks.
10k/wav/1031.wav|EN-US|EN| Don't decide your breath.
10k/wav/1034.wav|EN-US|EN| Thumb action must be taken.
10k/wav/104.wav|EN-US|EN| Then it developed into civil and criminal
10k/wav/1041.wav|EN-US|EN| We coordinate to get enough of it.
10k/wav/1043.wav|EN-US|EN| Move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
10k/wav/1047.wav|EN-US|EN| Angels are struggling and their team have injuries.
10k/wav/1059.wav|EN-US|EN| Ms McNeil was killed on impact.
10k/wav/1069.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a piece of art.
10k/wav/1075.wav|EN-US|EN| We haven't been able to go and see
10k/wav/108.wav|EN-US|EN| That was him under pressure.
10k/wav/1084.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a takeover.
10k/wav/1101.wav|EN-US|EN| This country has many challenges.
10k/wav/1103.wav|EN-US|EN| We have come on about him then.
10k/wav/1104.wav|EN-US|EN| Three hours later the man was free.
10k/wav/1110.wav|EN-US|EN| They are still going to be impulsive.
10k/wav/1116.wav|EN-US|EN| stint by fraction
10k/wav/114.wav|EN-US|EN| People are using it in their daily lives.
10k/wav/1143.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't look good for her.
10k/wav/1145.wav|EN-US|EN| He works at the airport.
10k/wav/1148.wav|EN-US|EN| He doesn't need to have people.
10k/wav/115.wav|EN-US|EN| The night is young.
10k/wav/1151.wav|EN-US|EN| She was light about the struggle.
10k/wav/1153.wav|EN-US|EN| However, Dinty deserves to win this game.
10k/wav/1160.wav|EN-US|EN| Harry Potter has lost his magic.
10k/wav/1171.wav|EN-US|EN| The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
10k/wav/1175.wav|EN-US|EN| Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
10k/wav/1176.wav|EN-US|EN| We would certainly consider the proposals.
10k/wav/1177.wav|EN-US|EN| Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
10k/wav/1179.wav|EN-US|EN| He was too good for me, too consistent.
10k/wav/1191.wav|EN-US|EN| I certainly do not agree with that.
10k/wav/1193.wav|EN-US|EN| 3 hit the target
10k/wav/122.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he was sorry.
10k/wav/1231.wav|EN-US|EN| I will have to order its destruction.
10k/wav/1273.wav|EN-US|EN| It would have been on the turn of the century.
10k/wav/1277.wav|EN-US|EN| It all began as an accident.
10k/wav/1279.wav|EN-US|EN| It had been played at festivals.
10k/wav/1292.wav|EN-US|EN| I was released up to six days.
10k/wav/1297.wav|EN-US|EN| Those three weeks are totally lost.
10k/wav/1303.wav|EN-US|EN| Third pool is very easy. You have to work for the team.
10k/wav/1308.wav|EN-US|EN| She is well balanced.
10k/wav/1324.wav|EN-US|EN| But we are severely limited in funds.
10k/wav/1345.wav|EN-US|EN| That's just the kind of thing we have.
10k/wav/1346.wav|EN-US|EN| I think they are right to be impatient.
10k/wav/135.wav|EN-US|EN| We have reports of this for our Scotland.
10k/wav/1352.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything is possible in football.
10k/wav/1360.wav|EN-US|EN| That will reduce my chance of selection.
10k/wav/1361.wav|EN-US|EN| Who would be a referee?
10k/wav/1379.wav|EN-US|EN| It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
10k/wav/1386.wav|EN-US|EN| Russell is delighted with them.
10k/wav/1391.wav|EN-US|EN| We all ecstatic.
10k/wav/1400.wav|EN-US|EN| These days we'll be back.
10k/wav/1403.wav|EN-US|EN| Bolt casting will beat up of the agenda.
10k/wav/1406.wav|EN-US|EN| We are looking forward to next season.
10k/wav/1407.wav|EN-US|EN| The truth is it is somewhere in the middle.
10k/wav/1417.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to start again on Saturday.
10k/wav/1428.wav|EN-US|EN| We have seen a copy of the report.
10k/wav/1429.wav|EN-US|EN| It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
10k/wav/1430.wav|EN-US|EN| What was it like playing real people?
10k/wav/1433.wav|EN-US|EN| Last week against Nelson, we learned them several opportunities.
10k/wav/1442.wav|EN-US|EN| But by that time it was too late.
10k/wav/1459.wav|EN-US|EN| I could not do it.
10k/wav/1463.wav|EN-US|EN| My plays are precious to me.
10k/wav/1472.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very shocked
10k/wav/1484.wav|EN-US|EN| We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
10k/wav/1485.wav|EN-US|EN| There was nobody on the roof.
10k/wav/1507.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a matter of juice.
10k/wav/1513.wav|EN-US|EN| Retirement. Dooness.
10k/wav/1514.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to be put in context.
10k/wav/1523.wav|EN-US|EN| They, the two children.
10k/wav/1527.wav|EN-US|EN| I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
10k/wav/1538.wav|EN-US|EN| This is bound to happen.
10k/wav/1539.wav|EN-US|EN| Until they have sex.
10k/wav/1549.wav|EN-US|EN| It all depends on the Chancellor.
10k/wav/157.wav|EN-US|EN| Did you see that?
10k/wav/1573.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time to give her rust.
10k/wav/1580.wav|EN-US|EN| The thumping is now there.
10k/wav/1588.wav|EN-US|EN| She doesn't know where to begin.
10k/wav/1590.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to alarm each other.
10k/wav/1600.wav|EN-US|EN| However, that is just for starters.
10k/wav/1603.wav|EN-US|EN| I am relishing the challenge
10k/wav/1609.wav|EN-US|EN| They could have been told in advance.
10k/wav/1613.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot believe this decision.
10k/wav/1625.wav|EN-US|EN| He is believed to live in Britain.
10k/wav/1638.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
10k/wav/1659.wav|EN-US|EN| Bloutless response was weak.
10k/wav/1662.wav|EN-US|EN| That was our last chance to do something.
10k/wav/1664.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just awful.
10k/wav/1688.wav|EN-US|EN| I have proven that in the past.
10k/wav/1714.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no rescue.
10k/wav/1723.wav|EN-US|EN| It had to happen.
10k/wav/1725.wav|EN-US|EN| The work was suspended for in the kidnap.
10k/wav/1733.wav|EN-US|EN| We cannot lease it.
10k/wav/1748.wav|EN-US|EN| But this has already been rejected.
10k/wav/1751.wav|EN-US|EN| They responded with victories.
10k/wav/1757.wav|EN-US|EN| That is as it may be.
10k/wav/1759.wav|EN-US|EN| Or was it?
10k/wav/1761.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very unlikely to feature against Thailand
10k/wav/1789.wav|EN-US|EN| He was popular.
10k/wav/1791.wav|EN-US|EN| Insurance will perhaps reduce.
10k/wav/1801.wav|EN-US|EN| Sub not used with K
10k/wav/1815.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not been banned from Celtic Park for life.
10k/wav/1817.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never considered it.
10k/wav/1818.wav|EN-US|EN| The best marriages are made in heaven.
10k/wav/1820.wav|EN-US|EN| How did it all come about?
10k/wav/1825.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's not be too despondent.
10k/wav/183.wav|EN-US|EN| The pudgy follows the mind.
10k/wav/1835.wav|EN-US|EN| People will have to be patient.
10k/wav/1839.wav|EN-US|EN| Our young people are leaving.
10k/wav/1840.wav|EN-US|EN| This takes the pressure off.
10k/wav/1848.wav|EN-US|EN| He did not provide us with a proposal.
10k/wav/1853.wav|EN-US|EN| We're so involved in creating the work.
10k/wav/1857.wav|EN-US|EN| I would just like someone to confess.
10k/wav/1865.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no discussion about it.
10k/wav/1867.wav|EN-US|EN| It has certainly paid off for him.
10k/wav/1880.wav|EN-US|EN| It was between myself, the management and the team.
10k/wav/1883.wav|EN-US|EN| I should say so.
10k/wav/1892.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope it comes out alright.
10k/wav/1893.wav|EN-US|EN| The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
10k/wav/1896.wav|EN-US|EN| It is high time to act.
10k/wav/1898.wav|EN-US|EN| Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
10k/wav/1904.wav|EN-US|EN| But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
10k/wav/1921.wav|EN-US|EN| Alan Johnston was not much fit.
10k/wav/1928.wav|EN-US|EN| Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
10k/wav/1940.wav|EN-US|EN| It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
10k/wav/1950.wav|EN-US|EN| We have fun in our lives.
10k/wav/1981.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
10k/wav/2005.wav|EN-US|EN| Except for this, it was offside.
10k/wav/2010.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you up for business?
10k/wav/2013.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't come any better than this.
10k/wav/2022.wav|EN-US|EN| It would have been a very explosive issue.
10k/wav/2023.wav|EN-US|EN| It was important to win this angle.
10k/wav/2032.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt my father was very hard.
10k/wav/2048.wav|EN-US|EN| I would say the position is open.
10k/wav/2064.wav|EN-US|EN| There are still some matters to be discussed.
10k/wav/2078.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not feel the pressure.
10k/wav/208.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like a score in some ways.
10k/wav/2088.wav|EN-US|EN| It months later he was dead.
10k/wav/2094.wav|EN-US|EN| The conclusion is in front.
10k/wav/2097.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you know who we are?
10k/wav/2099.wav|EN-US|EN| Holland won by 5 wickets.
10k/wav/2112.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a data management problem.
10k/wav/2138.wav|EN-US|EN| It's their new thing.
10k/wav/2159.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it has had a neolomated uptake.
10k/wav/2167.wav|EN-US|EN| All my training is for Athens
10k/wav/2174.wav|EN-US|EN| evidence that it was a summer bin laden.
10k/wav/2181.wav|EN-US|EN| We were still talking about it.
10k/wav/2186.wav|EN-US|EN| It was time to act.
10k/wav/2188.wav|EN-US|EN| Times have changed, but have they improved?
10k/wav/219.wav|EN-US|EN| I do not attempt to answer that.
10k/wav/2195.wav|EN-US|EN| The auction has seven days to run.
10k/wav/2198.wav|EN-US|EN| I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
10k/wav/2204.wav|EN-US|EN| He has many offers from the English promotion.
10k/wav/2217.wav|EN-US|EN| That rewarded the dynamics of Scottish politics.
10k/wav/2224.wav|EN-US|EN| That's all I can say.
10k/wav/2228.wav|EN-US|EN| I just want to change math.
10k/wav/2257.wav|EN-US|EN| I was in prison for a year.
10k/wav/2259.wav|EN-US|EN| It was like a cake in the bay.
10k/wav/2261.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we finished fifth.
10k/wav/2266.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not name it.
10k/wav/2280.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very moving actually.
10k/wav/2301.wav|EN-US|EN| They do the work, you know.
10k/wav/2314.wav|EN-US|EN| I was totally wrong.
10k/wav/2326.wav|EN-US|EN| You see, I back has gone.
10k/wav/233.wav|EN-US|EN| You do have a wout.
10k/wav/234.wav|EN-US|EN| I would miss him.
10k/wav/2357.wav|EN-US|EN| I would have dropped out otherwise.
10k/wav/2364.wav|EN-US|EN| At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
10k/wav/2370.wav|EN-US|EN| And that he has decided enough.
10k/wav/2371.wav|EN-US|EN| The season has been concerned to history.
10k/wav/2380.wav|EN-US|EN| It's so creative and event
10k/wav/2383.wav|EN-US|EN| Have I really come to this?
10k/wav/2399.wav|EN-US|EN| You don't do the same thing with men.
10k/wav/2402.wav|EN-US|EN| On Wednesday, it is the turn of cable whalers.
10k/wav/2404.wav|EN-US|EN| The four characters could be once somebody's suggested.
10k/wav/2408.wav|EN-US|EN| I would put my money on Peter Donald.
10k/wav/2413.wav|EN-US|EN| Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the comments yesterday.
10k/wav/2414.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
10k/wav/2418.wav|EN-US|EN| It is as eventful as it is momentous.
10k/wav/2428.wav|EN-US|EN| I think the referee was good.
10k/wav/2433.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
10k/wav/2440.wav|EN-US|EN| Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
10k/wav/2453.wav|EN-US|EN| It's terrible that he has died the same way.
10k/wav/2466.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a major championship.
10k/wav/248.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no threat to them.
10k/wav/2483.wav|EN-US|EN| I guess I was lucky though.
10k/wav/2495.wav|EN-US|EN| It is quite a figure.
10k/wav/2515.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm going to win the next two.
10k/wav/2523.wav|EN-US|EN| He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
10k/wav/2525.wav|EN-US|EN| That's no butting.
10k/wav/2537.wav|EN-US|EN| Like the others he was rested.
10k/wav/2540.wav|EN-US|EN| There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
10k/wav/2562.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not hard to get involved.
10k/wav/2564.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think they can complain about that.
10k/wav/2579.wav|EN-US|EN| This takes no count of Hataan tourism horses.
10k/wav/2590.wav|EN-US|EN| And what was that like as an experience?
10k/wav/2609.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an amazing result.
10k/wav/2613.wav|EN-US|EN| He was at standing today, the best player on the park.
10k/wav/2619.wav|EN-US|EN| Tomorrow you will make a keynote speech on Europe.
10k/wav/262.wav|EN-US|EN| They must put them back.
10k/wav/2632.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not missing much.
10k/wav/2639.wav|EN-US|EN| Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
10k/wav/2642.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm feeling a bit better.
10k/wav/2652.wav|EN-US|EN| It would also delay the Scottish results.
10k/wav/2670.wav|EN-US|EN| We do not have the papers.
10k/wav/2674.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a wellful act of violence.
10k/wav/2689.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no plan B.
10k/wav/2698.wav|EN-US|EN| which is not just in control of this golf game.
10k/wav/2703.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just a matter of time.
10k/wav/2706.wav|EN-US|EN| I was on the road.
10k/wav/2715.wav|EN-US|EN| The meaning is very profound and complex.
10k/wav/2722.wav|EN-US|EN| The trial is set for February.
10k/wav/2736.wav|EN-US|EN| Some were closed to toes.
10k/wav/2737.wav|EN-US|EN| I was furious about it.
10k/wav/2738.wav|EN-US|EN| He did not oppose the divorce.
10k/wav/2746.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be unsafe.
10k/wav/2747.wav|EN-US|EN| This will get their attention.
10k/wav/2753.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never done that.
10k/wav/2754.wav|EN-US|EN| We are on the path of change.
10k/wav/2755.wav|EN-US|EN| She admitted the theft of Leiter's interception.
10k/wav/2756.wav|EN-US|EN| It is an industry failure
10k/wav/2763.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the face of her.
10k/wav/2764.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it's a big advantage to us.
10k/wav/2770.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a discussion paper.
10k/wav/2771.wav|EN-US|EN| But the disease has not been confirmed to the Tory party.
10k/wav/2773.wav|EN-US|EN| Italy was just behind us.
10k/wav/2797.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a huge boost for my confidence.
10k/wav/2804.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been thinking, what would be easier?
10k/wav/2824.wav|EN-US|EN| I really want to win in Glasgow.
10k/wav/2839.wav|EN-US|EN| They are very keen to work with us.
10k/wav/286.wav|EN-US|EN| The director is the G News.
10k/wav/2866.wav|EN-US|EN| The foreign office was conspicuous by its absence.
10k/wav/2881.wav|EN-US|EN| There is nothing they cannot do.
10k/wav/2893.wav|EN-US|EN| He had just returned to Taland from Kaludur.
10k/wav/2901.wav|EN-US|EN| Lumberton had a lucky escape.
10k/wav/2919.wav|EN-US|EN| It will vote with us.
10k/wav/2942.wav|EN-US|EN| As good as they come.
10k/wav/2949.wav|EN-US|EN| The new scheme will have its entrance and conditions.
10k/wav/2954.wav|EN-US|EN| McMaster had already seen the first pot.
10k/wav/2986.wav|EN-US|EN| Lovely days and update.
10k/wav/2994.wav|EN-US|EN| It is used by a technical college.
10k/wav/2996.wav|EN-US|EN| My husband was angry.
10k/wav/2998.wav|EN-US|EN| I was going to help with the dinner.
10k/wav/3.wav|EN-US|EN| No options are excluded at all.
10k/wav/300.wav|EN-US|EN| What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
10k/wav/3010.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no easy answer.
10k/wav/3013.wav|EN-US|EN| They might want to play.
10k/wav/3018.wav|EN-US|EN| It has changed and not for the better.
10k/wav/302.wav|EN-US|EN| But Boss said the prediction was premature.
10k/wav/303.wav|EN-US|EN| We will win this day.
10k/wav/3031.wav|EN-US|EN| It simply doesn't happen.
10k/wav/3033.wav|EN-US|EN| The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
10k/wav/306.wav|EN-US|EN| Who are the Democrats?
10k/wav/3072.wav|EN-US|EN| Several hundred people attended yesterday.
10k/wav/3075.wav|EN-US|EN| I think the government should pay for that.
10k/wav/3114.wav|EN-US|EN| He saw it all as a big game.
10k/wav/3127.wav|EN-US|EN| I was invited to work in Germany.
10k/wav/313.wav|EN-US|EN| That there is to miss the point.
10k/wav/3140.wav|EN-US|EN| Was everything done to save people?
10k/wav/3149.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Plahantanwal.
10k/wav/3159.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
10k/wav/3170.wav|EN-US|EN| Another case of fidget and mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
10k/wav/318.wav|EN-US|EN| That case has still not been settled.
10k/wav/3182.wav|EN-US|EN| The service is expected to be introduced in December.
10k/wav/3188.wav|EN-US|EN| We now have to concentrate on the leak.
10k/wav/3197.wav|EN-US|EN| I've had a ball.
10k/wav/3205.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't mean to kill them.
10k/wav/3234.wav|EN-US|EN| Israeli forces denied the claim.
10k/wav/3244.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a young team, you know.
10k/wav/3253.wav|EN-US|EN| It's changed my life.
10k/wav/3261.wav|EN-US|EN| The couple actually came upon the accident.
10k/wav/3266.wav|EN-US|EN| We know the goals will come.
10k/wav/3278.wav|EN-US|EN| She doesn't know the half of it.
10k/wav/3290.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the tape of the ice book.
10k/wav/3315.wav|EN-US|EN| sub not used big call
10k/wav/3339.wav|EN-US|EN| You are not in any kind of trouble.
10k/wav/3345.wav|EN-US|EN| The kids are paying the price.
10k/wav/3347.wav|EN-US|EN| I do not like to lose.
10k/wav/3353.wav|EN-US|EN| Phil Mickelson did that last year.
10k/wav/3361.wav|EN-US|EN| It is simple and easy to use.
10k/wav/3369.wav|EN-US|EN| the things writers and directors say.
10k/wav/337.wav|EN-US|EN| No one has picked into me.
10k/wav/3374.wav|EN-US|EN| They should also have the right to vote.
10k/wav/3386.wav|EN-US|EN| Is it a warning to parents?
10k/wav/3421.wav|EN-US|EN| Stuff should be paid for what they produce.
10k/wav/3452.wav|EN-US|EN| Too often it is not.
10k/wav/3468.wav|EN-US|EN| He suffered severe heart injuries.
10k/wav/3494.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two ways to start a festival
10k/wav/3514.wav|EN-US|EN| The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
10k/wav/3515.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
10k/wav/3520.wav|EN-US|EN| Thankfully, no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
10k/wav/3525.wav|EN-US|EN| He should do matches the winner.
10k/wav/3532.wav|EN-US|EN| I sit in the car.
10k/wav/3565.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not the case in Europe.
10k/wav/3569.wav|EN-US|EN| Extend auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
10k/wav/3581.wav|EN-US|EN| that the improvement in behaviour was huge.
10k/wav/3600.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's not make that mistake again.
10k/wav/3608.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
10k/wav/3622.wav|EN-US|EN| Police have refused to name the couple involved.
10k/wav/363.wav|EN-US|EN| Off I went.
10k/wav/3631.wav|EN-US|EN| He died the following year.
10k/wav/3633.wav|EN-US|EN| We know we can defend it.
10k/wav/3636.wav|EN-US|EN| He died in September.
10k/wav/3648.wav|EN-US|EN| The venelets will not be replaced.
10k/wav/3666.wav|EN-US|EN| We are satisfied with this outcome.
10k/wav/3674.wav|EN-US|EN| No one in Downing Street can speak the language of the movements.
10k/wav/3679.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, they have the opposite effect
10k/wav/3682.wav|EN-US|EN| letter does not lose appeal
10k/wav/3685.wav|EN-US|EN| She collapsed and died a day later.
10k/wav/3690.wav|EN-US|EN| The plays will be done.
10k/wav/3694.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know why it's wet.
10k/wav/3704.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, I have even heard a bet on them.
10k/wav/3739.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to adapt to this level.
10k/wav/3746.wav|EN-US|EN| That is clearly not happening fast enough.
10k/wav/3751.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
10k/wav/3762.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the matter is not going to end there
10k/wav/3764.wav|EN-US|EN| He died later in hospital.
10k/wav/3770.wav|EN-US|EN| This must have been severe.
10k/wav/3787.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a terrible equation.
10k/wav/3789.wav|EN-US|EN| Because huge willies.
10k/wav/3794.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a difficult one to comment on.
10k/wav/38.wav|EN-US|EN| In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
10k/wav/3808.wav|EN-US|EN| The decision is purely done to the clinic.
10k/wav/3811.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been such a long call.
10k/wav/3812.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no point in looking any further.
10k/wav/3830.wav|EN-US|EN| He thought he had a month to cross the street.
10k/wav/3839.wav|EN-US|EN| As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
10k/wav/3849.wav|EN-US|EN| I hadn't been looking after myself.
10k/wav/3850.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't play badly.
10k/wav/3855.wav|EN-US|EN| It's about doing things.
10k/wav/3883.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the theory.
10k/wav/390.wav|EN-US|EN| He had missed a penalty against the English.
10k/wav/3901.wav|EN-US|EN| It will come up here.
10k/wav/3914.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Levingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
10k/wav/3930.wav|EN-US|EN| He was the Bill Cates of Theatre.
10k/wav/3939.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't play all the 12.
10k/wav/3960.wav|EN-US|EN| He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
10k/wav/3973.wav|EN-US|EN| That is far too high.
10k/wav/3979.wav|EN-US|EN| Detection is often difficult.
10k/wav/3986.wav|EN-US|EN| It is best value.
10k/wav/3987.wav|EN-US|EN| We have them all on the high ground.
10k/wav/3989.wav|EN-US|EN| The statement contained no surprises.
10k/wav/4014.wav|EN-US|EN| Britain has never had its circuit.
10k/wav/4018.wav|EN-US|EN| Tony Bletts, official specsman, said.
10k/wav/4031.wav|EN-US|EN| See the amazing hurricanes of this they say.
10k/wav/4032.wav|EN-US|EN| We are in a global market.
10k/wav/4040.wav|EN-US|EN| It was one of the firemen.
10k/wav/4052.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
10k/wav/4061.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
10k/wav/4062.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, the climate has changed
10k/wav/4076.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the best moment of my career.
10k/wav/4124.wav|EN-US|EN| Pressure of work is no excuse.
10k/wav/4126.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a different animal.
10k/wav/4127.wav|EN-US|EN| They will be very physical.
10k/wav/4141.wav|EN-US|EN| It was Dendros but vital employment
10k/wav/4144.wav|EN-US|EN| I am looking forward to raising Donovan.
10k/wav/4152.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw them last week.
10k/wav/4155.wav|EN-US|EN| They are taking a stand against this.
10k/wav/4183.wav|EN-US|EN| Your father was a good man.
10k/wav/4185.wav|EN-US|EN| And that was just the start.
10k/wav/4189.wav|EN-US|EN| Tourism continues to struggle.
10k/wav/4190.wav|EN-US|EN| The club has never won it.
10k/wav/4191.wav|EN-US|EN| that chose the latter
10k/wav/4194.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not retaining him.
10k/wav/423.wav|EN-US|EN| Chess is outside the Langut.
10k/wav/4236.wav|EN-US|EN| The refugees were welcomed by business lobby groups.
10k/wav/4246.wav|EN-US|EN| He will not be carrying out any surgery.
10k/wav/4250.wav|EN-US|EN| No meaningful response was issued.
10k/wav/4251.wav|EN-US|EN| The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
10k/wav/4252.wav|EN-US|EN| I was angry.
10k/wav/4267.wav|EN-US|EN| I enjoy playing with both of them
10k/wav/4269.wav|EN-US|EN| Kilbut was not amazed.
10k/wav/4273.wav|EN-US|EN| His condition was stable last night.
10k/wav/4287.wav|EN-US|EN| Correction. Ning him, he might.
10k/wav/4289.wav|EN-US|EN| What do we want to do that for?
10k/wav/430.wav|EN-US|EN| The boat was fantastic.
10k/wav/4319.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to be fun.
10k/wav/432.wav|EN-US|EN| As two candidates are proposed, a vet is taken.
10k/wav/4335.wav|EN-US|EN| I haven't won the world title.
10k/wav/4346.wav|EN-US|EN| as it turned out it was a triumph
10k/wav/435.wav|EN-US|EN| What's it for?
10k/wav/4351.wav|EN-US|EN| Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
10k/wav/4368.wav|EN-US|EN| The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
10k/wav/4374.wav|EN-US|EN| It took five months to repair the damage.
10k/wav/4384.wav|EN-US|EN| He said it was for sale.
10k/wav/4393.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been so lucky.
10k/wav/4422.wav|EN-US|EN| The tickets are on their way
10k/wav/4423.wav|EN-US|EN| This one would have been.
10k/wav/4439.wav|EN-US|EN| Heating was unlucky not to get a goal.
10k/wav/4458.wav|EN-US|EN| I am quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
10k/wav/4474.wav|EN-US|EN| I should never have come over to Fife.
10k/wav/4485.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been my life.
10k/wav/449.wav|EN-US|EN| The event has now gone to Helsinki.
10k/wav/4494.wav|EN-US|EN| If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
10k/wav/4521.wav|EN-US|EN| Andy was a huge influence yet again.
10k/wav/4536.wav|EN-US|EN| Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back and commending.
10k/wav/4562.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was a struggle.
10k/wav/457.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a terrible equation.
10k/wav/4575.wav|EN-US|EN| The performance for the Cessna didn't come off.
10k/wav/4586.wav|EN-US|EN| That became an accident.
10k/wav/4600.wav|EN-US|EN| We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
10k/wav/4603.wav|EN-US|EN| It will not be easy for him.
10k/wav/4617.wav|EN-US|EN| We will pay their bills.
10k/wav/4624.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't expect to be in...
10k/wav/4645.wav|EN-US|EN| The way they play it is hard to score against them.
10k/wav/4667.wav|EN-US|EN| Horses are drawn by ballot.
10k/wav/4671.wav|EN-US|EN| On the night, it was not enough.
10k/wav/469.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not about changing our image.
10k/wav/4696.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got to get the points from this on.
10k/wav/4725.wav|EN-US|EN| They are very clever in their use of words.
10k/wav/4729.wav|EN-US|EN| They may be wrong.
10k/wav/4738.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was to Novo.
10k/wav/4765.wav|EN-US|EN| What was the main difference?
10k/wav/4768.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland came very close in the second test.
10k/wav/4775.wav|EN-US|EN| It was as if it was all happening at a cordon porti.
10k/wav/4780.wav|EN-US|EN| Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
10k/wav/4781.wav|EN-US|EN| After that, though, we were still waiting to see.
10k/wav/4800.wav|EN-US|EN| A final decision is expected by Friday.
10k/wav/4806.wav|EN-US|EN| There was only one hole in it.
10k/wav/4841.wav|EN-US|EN| But don't expect an easy route.
10k/wav/4845.wav|EN-US|EN| Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
10k/wav/4846.wav|EN-US|EN| He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
10k/wav/485.wav|EN-US|EN| But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
10k/wav/4858.wav|EN-US|EN| Then came the crunch.
10k/wav/486.wav|EN-US|EN| Pounds of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
10k/wav/4860.wav|EN-US|EN| The love I felt was over.
10k/wav/4866.wav|EN-US|EN| I got a jello cart.
10k/wav/4877.wav|EN-US|EN| We come here in peace, for peace.
10k/wav/4888.wav|EN-US|EN| Clable Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
10k/wav/4891.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a complex and detailed report.
10k/wav/4896.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been just enjoying every match.
10k/wav/4928.wav|EN-US|EN| It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
10k/wav/4929.wav|EN-US|EN| Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the Abbey.
10k/wav/4934.wav|EN-US|EN| We were lucky to have survived.
10k/wav/4943.wav|EN-US|EN| It was his own decision.
10k/wav/4949.wav|EN-US|EN| The only trouble is finding them.
10k/wav/4963.wav|EN-US|EN| His father said why some was lucky.
10k/wav/4968.wav|EN-US|EN| You've been working for four years.
10k/wav/497.wav|EN-US|EN| but he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
10k/wav/4970.wav|EN-US|EN| Who can predict?
10k/wav/4976.wav|EN-US|EN| Just look at his fashion sense.
10k/wav/5000.wav|EN-US|EN| There are not enough of them
10k/wav/5001.wav|EN-US|EN| I sit at home a lot.
10k/wav/501.wav|EN-US|EN| She is having an affair with his partner.
10k/wav/503.wav|EN-US|EN| It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
10k/wav/5031.wav|EN-US|EN| I first changed for rugby players in just three years.
10k/wav/5035.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a great carry-over valley.
10k/wav/5036.wav|EN-US|EN| However, this suggestion was tonked down by the player.
10k/wav/5037.wav|EN-US|EN| Women were mostly notable by their absence.
10k/wav/5045.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
10k/wav/5046.wav|EN-US|EN| Ahem is your home.
10k/wav/5055.wav|EN-US|EN| I've had my time.
10k/wav/5063.wav|EN-US|EN| I got this surprise of my life.
10k/wav/5070.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not looking forward to it.
10k/wav/5074.wav|EN-US|EN| Focusome did not hesitate.
10k/wav/5085.wav|EN-US|EN| They were too hot.
10k/wav/5101.wav|EN-US|EN| It has never been worthwhile.
10k/wav/5135.wav|EN-US|EN| Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
10k/wav/5149.wav|EN-US|EN| His name is Mike Colon.
10k/wav/516.wav|EN-US|EN| It was extremely difficult.
10k/wav/5166.wav|EN-US|EN| Watto Money was intended to be used for good causes.
10k/wav/5172.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
10k/wav/5187.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't know what he was capable of.
10k/wav/5209.wav|EN-US|EN| Then you sit.
10k/wav/5220.wav|EN-US|EN| Lord Biden motorists have nothing to fear.
10k/wav/5225.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never done that before in my life.
10k/wav/5241.wav|EN-US|EN| From day one, we were family.
10k/wav/5259.wav|EN-US|EN| The Commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
10k/wav/5323.wav|EN-US|EN| Stephen will get his first cop.
10k/wav/5332.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a hell of a ray.
10k/wav/5339.wav|EN-US|EN| This is your chance
10k/wav/5373.wav|EN-US|EN| We are really impressed.
10k/wav/5381.wav|EN-US|EN| No one in the passenger train was hurt.
10k/wav/5382.wav|EN-US|EN| Herring is easy, after all
10k/wav/5389.wav|EN-US|EN| The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
10k/wav/5403.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to see as much progress as possible.
10k/wav/5404.wav|EN-US|EN| It has a rally instead of a conference.
10k/wav/5429.wav|EN-US|EN| Henny has job inside out.
10k/wav/5436.wav|EN-US|EN| Each one is as good as the other.
10k/wav/5447.wav|EN-US|EN| He had never run the distance before.
10k/wav/5449.wav|EN-US|EN| Our people are ready.
10k/wav/5489.wav|EN-US|EN| Basically we lost the game because we were tapped late.
10k/wav/549.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't so pathetic. It would be funny.
10k/wav/5491.wav|EN-US|EN| It is also hoped big name styles could be brought on board.
10k/wav/5493.wav|EN-US|EN| What does this mean?
10k/wav/5529.wav|EN-US|EN| Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
10k/wav/553.wav|EN-US|EN| But there are no plans.
10k/wav/5531.wav|EN-US|EN| within a state of shotgun disbelief.
10k/wav/5543.wav|EN-US|EN| This is no reflection on ranges.
10k/wav/5568.wav|EN-US|EN| Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
10k/wav/5571.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a hot came to plane. Very tough.
10k/wav/559.wav|EN-US|EN| It's never the same problem.
10k/wav/5602.wav|EN-US|EN| Our future is in the marathon.
10k/wav/5604.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not the message alone.
10k/wav/5632.wav|EN-US|EN| Ian Duncan Smith is a decent man.
10k/wav/5634.wav|EN-US|EN| Cough is an expensive cane for beginners.
10k/wav/5635.wav|EN-US|EN| The tribunal said his conduct was only reprehensible.
10k/wav/5640.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone is in favor of the need for welfare reform in general.
10k/wav/5657.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a script.
10k/wav/5672.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not sure about the rate of progress.
10k/wav/5674.wav|EN-US|EN| They were most achieved at all.
10k/wav/5692.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the best way to do it.
10k/wav/5715.wav|EN-US|EN| We have no choice but to shut down.
10k/wav/5717.wav|EN-US|EN| And a satellite.
10k/wav/5726.wav|EN-US|EN| The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
10k/wav/5729.wav|EN-US|EN| The track is currently covered in snow.
10k/wav/5742.wav|EN-US|EN| He was charged with pudgy.
10k/wav/5773.wav|EN-US|EN| That would depend on the Proport.
10k/wav/5789.wav|EN-US|EN| It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
10k/wav/5817.wav|EN-US|EN| His curry may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
10k/wav/582.wav|EN-US|EN| It's something he works hard at achieving.
10k/wav/5825.wav|EN-US|EN| We will not get rid of them.
10k/wav/5838.wav|EN-US|EN| Satellate is not.
10k/wav/5843.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a man of the people.
10k/wav/5848.wav|EN-US|EN| I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
10k/wav/5860.wav|EN-US|EN| That has been lost.
10k/wav/5871.wav|EN-US|EN| Klasko just asked Darwin, but we made them look good
10k/wav/588.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the same at Twickenham.
10k/wav/5883.wav|EN-US|EN| It ain't Duncan Smith's room.
10k/wav/5890.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a hidden problem.
10k/wav/5902.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not like other forms of discrimination.
10k/wav/5914.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Reet said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
10k/wav/5931.wav|EN-US|EN| Now you see them, now you don't.
10k/wav/5937.wav|EN-US|EN| My neighbours are horrified.
10k/wav/5938.wav|EN-US|EN| We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
10k/wav/594.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got a great defensive club.
10k/wav/5951.wav|EN-US|EN| Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
10k/wav/5953.wav|EN-US|EN| But nothing happened.
10k/wav/5965.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an interesting debate to get going.
10k/wav/5983.wav|EN-US|EN| I hate the word.
10k/wav/5996.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that not pathetic?
10k/wav/5997.wav|EN-US|EN| You have been warned.
10k/wav/6000.wav|EN-US|EN| They are just different.
10k/wav/6013.wav|EN-US|EN| Clark is back on top form.
10k/wav/6016.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to see the maximum of change.
10k/wav/602.wav|EN-US|EN| The world is split into two.
10k/wav/603.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
10k/wav/6032.wav|EN-US|EN| We should not be surprised.
10k/wav/6034.wav|EN-US|EN| We did it in one take.
10k/wav/604.wav|EN-US|EN| He has not created a festival resource.
10k/wav/6042.wav|EN-US|EN| I am looking to the future
10k/wav/6044.wav|EN-US|EN| The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
10k/wav/6046.wav|EN-US|EN| She becomes the mother.
10k/wav/6058.wav|EN-US|EN| Industrial action has to hurt.
10k/wav/6060.wav|EN-US|EN| It's nothing we could do about this.
10k/wav/6064.wav|EN-US|EN| We must pitter marker down.
10k/wav/6067.wav|EN-US|EN| He thinks have not happened by accident.
10k/wav/6071.wav|EN-US|EN| It is set in Paris.
10k/wav/6074.wav|EN-US|EN| This is in the meag of its sun.
10k/wav/6086.wav|EN-US|EN| It had so much to do with output.
10k/wav/6087.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't about one player.
10k/wav/6090.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not one for the purists.
10k/wav/6091.wav|EN-US|EN| Ivy got no secret
10k/wav/6107.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm proud of this, guys.
10k/wav/6109.wav|EN-US|EN| Have you heard anything from Paramount?
10k/wav/6113.wav|EN-US|EN| They enjoyed playing the game.
10k/wav/6124.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't even know his name.
10k/wav/6163.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not completely insane.
10k/wav/6164.wav|EN-US|EN| There's only one word for it.
10k/wav/6176.wav|EN-US|EN| Government will intervene.
10k/wav/6181.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just one of those things.
10k/wav/6210.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
10k/wav/622.wav|EN-US|EN| We could learn a lot from them.
10k/wav/6248.wav|EN-US|EN| The answer is with ourselves.
10k/wav/6273.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody said it was required.
10k/wav/628.wav|EN-US|EN| I have hardly any commitments.
10k/wav/6288.wav|EN-US|EN| The pig industry is on his knees.
10k/wav/6289.wav|EN-US|EN| And we were right.
10k/wav/6303.wav|EN-US|EN| I wouldn't even respond to that question.
10k/wav/6304.wav|EN-US|EN| The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
10k/wav/6328.wav|EN-US|EN| I am delighted for the lads.
10k/wav/6331.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue. She is given a new Deputy Minister for Transport and Planning.
10k/wav/6332.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a difficult job.
10k/wav/6334.wav|EN-US|EN| He was found to climb almost to the ometre.
10k/wav/6337.wav|EN-US|EN| What on earth is wrong with you?
10k/wav/6341.wav|EN-US|EN| Do not give your details to anyone.
10k/wav/6349.wav|EN-US|EN| It starts to get you done.
10k/wav/6356.wav|EN-US|EN| She was an enmity out
10k/wav/636.wav|EN-US|EN| They have a very good method of working.
10k/wav/6379.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a strong involvement.
10k/wav/638.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been surprised by the local reaction.
10k/wav/6386.wav|EN-US|EN| I have still to hear about that.
10k/wav/642.wav|EN-US|EN| But because of the water, no one had the experience.
10k/wav/6420.wav|EN-US|EN| It was that kind of afternoon.
10k/wav/6422.wav|EN-US|EN| They really had a go at us.
10k/wav/6429.wav|EN-US|EN| I could go, but none of these things is true.
10k/wav/6433.wav|EN-US|EN| We just need the government to act.
10k/wav/6440.wav|EN-US|EN| I can live with just the one.
10k/wav/6442.wav|EN-US|EN| The potential is always in the idea.
10k/wav/646.wav|EN-US|EN| We are delighted with this outcome.
10k/wav/6470.wav|EN-US|EN| Still, some additions are inspired.
10k/wav/649.wav|EN-US|EN| Our foot will remain on the table.
10k/wav/6496.wav|EN-US|EN| He was released after treatment.
10k/wav/6497.wav|EN-US|EN| I had a sense of DJV.
10k/wav/6498.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not all goodness and relief for labour, however.
10k/wav/6520.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never regretted my decision.
10k/wav/6531.wav|EN-US|EN| To begin with it looks good.
10k/wav/6535.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm prepared to help make it happen.
10k/wav/6544.wav|EN-US|EN| Then eat the money.
10k/wav/6587.wav|EN-US|EN| If not, ideal could take many months.
10k/wav/6595.wav|EN-US|EN| And each, indeed, it is
10k/wav/66.wav|EN-US|EN| I was an athlete.
10k/wav/6607.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just a fact.
10k/wav/6623.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a management problem in the hospital.
10k/wav/6626.wav|EN-US|EN| I know when my time is. It isn't to bother me.
10k/wav/6655.wav|EN-US|EN| and neither details have to be sorted out.
10k/wav/6661.wav|EN-US|EN| I shouldn't have put up with it.
10k/wav/6665.wav|EN-US|EN| They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
10k/wav/6672.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very funny.
10k/wav/6680.wav|EN-US|EN| His record with England was not good.
10k/wav/6685.wav|EN-US|EN| Which isn't your bad idea?
10k/wav/6699.wav|EN-US|EN| Look at the liberal Democrats.
10k/wav/6720.wav|EN-US|EN| In part that reflected the times.
10k/wav/6722.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone has this show of trouble.
10k/wav/6750.wav|EN-US|EN| We are taking that advice on this.
10k/wav/6753.wav|EN-US|EN| The programme has been made with great care.
10k/wav/6758.wav|EN-US|EN| That could be in place by next year.
10k/wav/6765.wav|EN-US|EN| I intended to look for another club online.
10k/wav/6785.wav|EN-US|EN| His was the best performance of the day after all.
10k/wav/6790.wav|EN-US|EN| Then was the summer of their discontent.
10k/wav/6802.wav|EN-US|EN| It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
10k/wav/6810.wav|EN-US|EN| It used to bother me sometimes, but it isn't anymore.
10k/wav/683.wav|EN-US|EN| The budget was too low for that.
10k/wav/6834.wav|EN-US|EN| I was contacted this morning.
10k/wav/6856.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you listening All Saints?
10k/wav/6860.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not covered by the insurance.
10k/wav/6865.wav|EN-US|EN| It is long come.
10k/wav/6868.wav|EN-US|EN| Their attitude is all wrong.
10k/wav/6881.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just not working.
10k/wav/6895.wav|EN-US|EN| It was all great training.
10k/wav/6900.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it was a different story in the final
10k/wav/6902.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a nivary nature of farming.
10k/wav/6903.wav|EN-US|EN| Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
10k/wav/6906.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just like any other club.
10k/wav/6911.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, he should never have been in the field.
10k/wav/6912.wav|EN-US|EN| It was clear.
10k/wav/6916.wav|EN-US|EN| I was never alone with her, but...
10k/wav/6937.wav|EN-US|EN| Brand has always protested his innocence.
10k/wav/6944.wav|EN-US|EN| It is upturned
10k/wav/6952.wav|EN-US|EN| In our view, the stock has financial risk.
10k/wav/6953.wav|EN-US|EN| I will not take part in Edmonton.
10k/wav/6954.wav|EN-US|EN| By this point the couple were approaching fast.
10k/wav/6960.wav|EN-US|EN| That's what sets him apart.
10k/wav/6962.wav|EN-US|EN| I never thought it would take this long.
10k/wav/6982.wav|EN-US|EN| But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
10k/wav/6987.wav|EN-US|EN| In my opinion it was a mistake and never on purpose.
10k/wav/6989.wav|EN-US|EN| The devil is in the detail.
10k/wav/6991.wav|EN-US|EN| You need insurance to bring people in.
10k/wav/6995.wav|EN-US|EN| I see no need to change
10k/wav/7.wav|EN-US|EN| I might have been sitting at home without a...
10k/wav/701.wav|EN-US|EN| It's happened, but it's a dream.
10k/wav/7015.wav|EN-US|EN| By then, however, both men were already in this.
10k/wav/7027.wav|EN-US|EN| That condition was described as stable.
10k/wav/7040.wav|EN-US|EN| Steering from the benefits system is no different.
10k/wav/7053.wav|EN-US|EN| Wealth is down though.
10k/wav/7055.wav|EN-US|EN| The very plain court is our only option.
10k/wav/7061.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a matter of balance.
10k/wav/7071.wav|EN-US|EN| He was the architect.
10k/wav/7088.wav|EN-US|EN| The real issue is personal.
10k/wav/709.wav|EN-US|EN| That will be important.
10k/wav/7129.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought he was at Fort.
10k/wav/7132.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a subtle difference.
10k/wav/7140.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time, he said.
10k/wav/7144.wav|EN-US|EN| People don't feel safe, including me.
10k/wav/7153.wav|EN-US|EN| Eiksunde was having none of it.
10k/wav/7154.wav|EN-US|EN| Private sector playwarts were major factor.
10k/wav/7162.wav|EN-US|EN| The truth will come out.
10k/wav/7168.wav|EN-US|EN| But we could not change his mind.
10k/wav/7176.wav|EN-US|EN| Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
10k/wav/7182.wav|EN-US|EN| It took an option on the process.
10k/wav/7193.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm amazed at what he's done.
10k/wav/7207.wav|EN-US|EN| You must have a government and a good civil service.
10k/wav/723.wav|EN-US|EN| He has yet to receive a reply.
10k/wav/7231.wav|EN-US|EN| A search and rescue mission was mounted in the minutes.
10k/wav/7250.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
10k/wav/7254.wav|EN-US|EN| But, for the money, he was not the man of the much.
10k/wav/7292.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not an insult.
10k/wav/7301.wav|EN-US|EN| What is the new religion?
10k/wav/7306.wav|EN-US|EN| This is clearly not abuse.
10k/wav/7320.wav|EN-US|EN| It was that butt, that low.
10k/wav/7328.wav|EN-US|EN| We know them as mobile telephones.
10k/wav/7329.wav|EN-US|EN| The improvement today was fantastic!
10k/wav/7330.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, there was still much to be done.
10k/wav/7337.wav|EN-US|EN| The power no strangers to smashing records.
10k/wav/7347.wav|EN-US|EN| Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
10k/wav/7365.wav|EN-US|EN| The cause of the crash wasn't clear.
10k/wav/7378.wav|EN-US|EN| You should try to have a laugh.
10k/wav/7386.wav|EN-US|EN| I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
10k/wav/7390.wav|EN-US|EN| The people will come.
10k/wav/7404.wav|EN-US|EN| That was merely their initial problem.
10k/wav/7407.wav|EN-US|EN| She is very upset.
10k/wav/7413.wav|EN-US|EN| This is normal for them.
10k/wav/7414.wav|EN-US|EN| Our message was inclusive.
10k/wav/7419.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very genuine prospect.
10k/wav/7421.wav|EN-US|EN| When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
10k/wav/7457.wav|EN-US|EN| rugby is not just like football
10k/wav/7474.wav|EN-US|EN| He can do no wrong.
10k/wav/7481.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like a gosh.
10k/wav/7495.wav|EN-US|EN| Surely the answer is yes.
10k/wav/7497.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just a different way of life.
10k/wav/7509.wav|EN-US|EN| I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
10k/wav/7529.wav|EN-US|EN| They have got their position We have got our position
10k/wav/7536.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not sure.
10k/wav/7541.wav|EN-US|EN| A lot has been written.
10k/wav/7544.wav|EN-US|EN| How are you today?
10k/wav/755.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not inclined to believe it.
10k/wav/7584.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the subway.
10k/wav/7586.wav|EN-US|EN| I watch the other visitors.
10k/wav/759.wav|EN-US|EN| It has, however, been a long time coming
10k/wav/7598.wav|EN-US|EN| Then there's the casting
10k/wav/7619.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the dead end.
10k/wav/7648.wav|EN-US|EN| People are trying to run away.
10k/wav/7649.wav|EN-US|EN| And I thought, we have to do something with this.
10k/wav/7651.wav|EN-US|EN| The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
10k/wav/7656.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland played a major part in the project.
10k/wav/7667.wav|EN-US|EN| I Kate in Scotland also refusing to comment
10k/wav/7676.wav|EN-US|EN| That was six years ago.
10k/wav/7677.wav|EN-US|EN| and it paid off.
10k/wav/7701.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't just lock in and get it.
10k/wav/7706.wav|EN-US|EN| This will help our confidence.
10k/wav/7728.wav|EN-US|EN| I would probably have to agree with him.
10k/wav/7730.wav|EN-US|EN| WebView has now changed completely.
10k/wav/7738.wav|EN-US|EN| Base management are very supportive.
10k/wav/7742.wav|EN-US|EN| I found Inu himself.
10k/wav/7749.wav|EN-US|EN| But we are losing that connection.
10k/wav/777.wav|EN-US|EN| These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
10k/wav/7800.wav|EN-US|EN| It does make a big difference.
10k/wav/7816.wav|EN-US|EN| The Hell Nation will be delighted.
10k/wav/7817.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not thinking too much about the toe.
10k/wav/7820.wav|EN-US|EN| I guess it is down to focus.
10k/wav/7828.wav|EN-US|EN| I had trouble with the producers.
10k/wav/7829.wav|EN-US|EN| Chris is big and jolly
10k/wav/7855.wav|EN-US|EN| That has not been the case as we now know.
10k/wav/7858.wav|EN-US|EN| This year it all went to a few £100,000.
10k/wav/7860.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a beautiful country.
10k/wav/7875.wav|EN-US|EN| Therefore this type of aircraft is completely safe.
10k/wav/7892.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the only nature of a British site on the list.
10k/wav/7900.wav|EN-US|EN| Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
10k/wav/7906.wav|EN-US|EN| Anything can happen at any moment.
10k/wav/7914.wav|EN-US|EN| Also the story goes...
10k/wav/7938.wav|EN-US|EN| It would still have been a good film but very different.
10k/wav/7939.wav|EN-US|EN| It was quite simply delicious.
10k/wav/794.wav|EN-US|EN| We act because we must.
10k/wav/7943.wav|EN-US|EN| He took my pathway.
10k/wav/7949.wav|EN-US|EN| Only the scale of change differed
10k/wav/7965.wav|EN-US|EN| The Duke of Slough thought me would still be there.
10k/wav/7970.wav|EN-US|EN| They would have been forgiven for doing so.
10k/wav/7980.wav|EN-US|EN| We could easily be cut again.
10k/wav/799.wav|EN-US|EN| Norman was not doing so bad either.
10k/wav/8010.wav|EN-US|EN| They never seem to do anything about it.
10k/wav/8011.wav|EN-US|EN| They finished second and that.
10k/wav/8012.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a catalog of obstruction.
10k/wav/8022.wav|EN-US|EN| So the process was refined.
10k/wav/8031.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the manager's decision.
10k/wav/8035.wav|EN-US|EN| William Hick, the guest of her, was delighted.
10k/wav/8040.wav|EN-US|EN| When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
10k/wav/8049.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to know more about her.
10k/wav/8060.wav|EN-US|EN| Instead, we make the crown to pay.
10k/wav/8061.wav|EN-US|EN| I must do something about it.
10k/wav/8119.wav|EN-US|EN| Mother Welt took them from Huff Chances.
10k/wav/8127.wav|EN-US|EN| Johnson was pretty low.
10k/wav/8139.wav|EN-US|EN| They wanted the club to make money.
10k/wav/8142.wav|EN-US|EN| I know rugby fans can help.
10k/wav/8158.wav|EN-US|EN| He added, it is all about the search for power.
10k/wav/8163.wav|EN-US|EN| We lost to a port team.
10k/wav/8173.wav|EN-US|EN| This is my life.
10k/wav/8187.wav|EN-US|EN| The world is being invited to visit.
10k/wav/8188.wav|EN-US|EN| She really suffered for her heart.
10k/wav/8189.wav|EN-US|EN| Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
10k/wav/8192.wav|EN-US|EN| And it's difficult to argue.
10k/wav/82.wav|EN-US|EN| We might be back next year.
10k/wav/8203.wav|EN-US|EN| She asked me for the appointment with me.
10k/wav/8208.wav|EN-US|EN| Growth will come later in the cycle.
10k/wav/821.wav|EN-US|EN| You can take it or miss any while and practice.
10k/wav/8213.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a long way to go this week.
10k/wav/8216.wav|EN-US|EN| That's been the difference between the sites.
10k/wav/8220.wav|EN-US|EN| Now there is an even bigger target.
10k/wav/8227.wav|EN-US|EN| He may not need to force that message.
10k/wav/823.wav|EN-US|EN| Colt admitted as much.
10k/wav/8231.wav|EN-US|EN| They want to win the title.
10k/wav/8235.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
10k/wav/8239.wav|EN-US|EN| We were caught at
10k/wav/824.wav|EN-US|EN| We are now in an election period.
10k/wav/8246.wav|EN-US|EN| He lost his job but it was not just a job.
10k/wav/8249.wav|EN-US|EN| Klaska is about to enter Nio.
10k/wav/8254.wav|EN-US|EN| I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
10k/wav/8258.wav|EN-US|EN| One might think that is a power.
10k/wav/8264.wav|EN-US|EN| He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.
10k/wav/8276.wav|EN-US|EN| You might even have seen him.
10k/wav/8277.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm confident of the outcome this week.
10k/wav/8331.wav|EN-US|EN| He is success story by any standard.
10k/wav/8335.wav|EN-US|EN| We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
10k/wav/8356.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not a happy man.
10k/wav/8363.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
10k/wav/84.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe in the Union.
10k/wav/8404.wav|EN-US|EN| The fire was above the hole.
10k/wav/8411.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got to get this right.
10k/wav/8416.wav|EN-US|EN| For once it was wrong.
10k/wav/8424.wav|EN-US|EN| They had to be cut from the wreckage.
10k/wav/8437.wav|EN-US|EN| They were mainly very positive about the role.
10k/wav/844.wav|EN-US|EN| I have thought a lot about the commonwealths.
10k/wav/8441.wav|EN-US|EN| I was impressed with them.
10k/wav/8446.wav|EN-US|EN| So is that it then?
10k/wav/8455.wav|EN-US|EN| The peace process will be buried.
10k/wav/8463.wav|EN-US|EN| But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
10k/wav/8470.wav|EN-US|EN| I've got nothing to say.
10k/wav/8485.wav|EN-US|EN| This is only the start of my season.
10k/wav/8497.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a stunning strike.
10k/wav/8498.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone could see the jerk.
10k/wav/8524.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to be an event.
10k/wav/8529.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything in the symphony is there.
10k/wav/8534.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the direction we need to go.
10k/wav/8541.wav|EN-US|EN| and the results were impressive.
10k/wav/8549.wav|EN-US|EN| There's still plenty time left.
10k/wav/8581.wav|EN-US|EN| Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
10k/wav/859.wav|EN-US|EN| Frankly, we were lucky to get second
10k/wav/8596.wav|EN-US|EN| We are seeing a government in a high.
10k/wav/8597.wav|EN-US|EN| This is absolutely not true.
10k/wav/86.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully, everything is for the best.
10k/wav/8601.wav|EN-US|EN| One of them, woman, is in serious condition.
10k/wav/861.wav|EN-US|EN| That nation is South Africa.
10k/wav/8622.wav|EN-US|EN| It's easy to be negative about these things.
10k/wav/8626.wav|EN-US|EN| It will siege a popular decision.
10k/wav/8631.wav|EN-US|EN| The sauce are just so good.
10k/wav/8637.wav|EN-US|EN| People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
10k/wav/8643.wav|EN-US|EN| Because of this, he fears the hearing had been unfair.
10k/wav/8646.wav|EN-US|EN| After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
10k/wav/8652.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a business to run.
10k/wav/8669.wav|EN-US|EN| Have we not been here before?
10k/wav/8673.wav|EN-US|EN| The package is a changing one.
10k/wav/8682.wav|EN-US|EN| The airport was even different.
10k/wav/8686.wav|EN-US|EN| This is an exciting time for the party.
10k/wav/8687.wav|EN-US|EN| How do we get a bigger stage here?
10k/wav/8698.wav|EN-US|EN| Here we go then.
10k/wav/8699.wav|EN-US|EN| Talks are attended at that stage.
10k/wav/8702.wav|EN-US|EN| Ask Tonight was a key episode.
10k/wav/8705.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no shortage of farmers.
10k/wav/8707.wav|EN-US|EN| Justice was not seen today.
10k/wav/8714.wav|EN-US|EN| They were urged to get themselves in order
10k/wav/872.wav|EN-US|EN| It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
10k/wav/8722.wav|EN-US|EN| Like anyone else, he has to take his time
10k/wav/8724.wav|EN-US|EN| Conditions were very difficult for the players.
10k/wav/874.wav|EN-US|EN| Its failure is no surprise.
10k/wav/875.wav|EN-US|EN| The settlement could run to millions.
10k/wav/8763.wav|EN-US|EN| There are many children
10k/wav/8767.wav|EN-US|EN| Nope, it is always over two games.
10k/wav/878.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to come up with a solution.
10k/wav/8783.wav|EN-US|EN| He just attracted people.
10k/wav/8788.wav|EN-US|EN| I was very surprised
10k/wav/8789.wav|EN-US|EN| It's clearly a budget.
10k/wav/8795.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be very good for rangers.
10k/wav/8807.wav|EN-US|EN| He has refused to do that.
10k/wav/8812.wav|EN-US|EN| Analysts were impressed with progress, mate.
10k/wav/8816.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no plan B if the Good Friday Agreement failed, he warned.
10k/wav/8826.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither was involved in violence.
10k/wav/8834.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just awful.
10k/wav/8835.wav|EN-US|EN| His silence on this issue is interesting.
10k/wav/8842.wav|EN-US|EN| On that side of an airport, it is very difficult.
10k/wav/8857.wav|EN-US|EN| There was much to be positive about.
10k/wav/8867.wav|EN-US|EN| It was bound to happen and it has happened.
10k/wav/8870.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you think we are at operation?
10k/wav/8882.wav|EN-US|EN| Sergeant Pissane has made the case against himself.
10k/wav/8888.wav|EN-US|EN| But don't just take my word for it.
10k/wav/8889.wav|EN-US|EN| I was all image and no substance.
10k/wav/8902.wav|EN-US|EN| Ellen is also prepared to take in refugees.
10k/wav/891.wav|EN-US|EN| I am totally horrified by the sentence.
10k/wav/8918.wav|EN-US|EN| He denied the chart.
10k/wav/8922.wav|EN-US|EN| Manager Poppy Williamson has no entryways.
10k/wav/8930.wav|EN-US|EN| Western countries condemn the conduct of the poem.
10k/wav/8939.wav|EN-US|EN| It was seriously unpleasant.
10k/wav/8947.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a total mystery.
10k/wav/8950.wav|EN-US|EN| This will take a dividend policy and capital structure.
10k/wav/8955.wav|EN-US|EN| That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it
10k/wav/8968.wav|EN-US|EN| That, however, was the exception.
10k/wav/8969.wav|EN-US|EN| Mist of the affected drops are in this.
10k/wav/8970.wav|EN-US|EN| We have avoided that at least.
10k/wav/8976.wav|EN-US|EN| We have tried to keep his head up.
10k/wav/8985.wav|EN-US|EN| Mandu, he hasn't been back for ages.
10k/wav/8991.wav|EN-US|EN| Famously though, there was a catch.
10k/wav/9040.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to keep the pound.
10k/wav/9043.wav|EN-US|EN| Our commitment is to move forward.
10k/wav/9044.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we are the better side.
10k/wav/9046.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be up to the government.
10k/wav/9061.wav|EN-US|EN| He could see no other bidder.
10k/wav/9065.wav|EN-US|EN| Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
10k/wav/9071.wav|EN-US|EN| They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
10k/wav/9079.wav|EN-US|EN| She also defended the Nord Chancellor's existing powers.
10k/wav/9087.wav|EN-US|EN| Fifty minutes later, they were found.
10k/wav/9095.wav|EN-US|EN| This time they are second bottom with three games left to play.
10k/wav/9120.wav|EN-US|EN| The call was ignored.
10k/wav/9128.wav|EN-US|EN| It puts the thought out for other people to think about.
10k/wav/9139.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe Dispatcher has been.
10k/wav/9141.wav|EN-US|EN| People can describe a moment in their life.
10k/wav/9145.wav|EN-US|EN| That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
10k/wav/916.wav|EN-US|EN| That should be fun.
10k/wav/9171.wav|EN-US|EN| We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
10k/wav/9177.wav|EN-US|EN| Then came the farewell to Europe
10k/wav/918.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm looking forward to getting home.
10k/wav/9203.wav|EN-US|EN| I want an answer from the British government.
10k/wav/9212.wav|EN-US|EN| It does not stop at the border.
10k/wav/9219.wav|EN-US|EN| They have been for some time now.
10k/wav/9226.wav|EN-US|EN| This idea has been owned for four years.
10k/wav/9242.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd never be free.
10k/wav/9249.wav|EN-US|EN| I am fighting the force of nature.
10k/wav/925.wav|EN-US|EN| It took more than two years.
10k/wav/9259.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be a huge difference.
10k/wav/9260.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not so simple.
10k/wav/9275.wav|EN-US|EN| Have you noticed?
10k/wav/9280.wav|EN-US|EN| A review group will report on Tuesday.
10k/wav/9283.wav|EN-US|EN| She was at the top.
10k/wav/93.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not changing my mind.
10k/wav/9301.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a fact.
10k/wav/9311.wav|EN-US|EN| There's no support for it at all.
10k/wav/9312.wav|EN-US|EN| He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
10k/wav/9317.wav|EN-US|EN| Also, it seemed.
10k/wav/9323.wav|EN-US|EN| The paragon ensemble is back.
10k/wav/9330.wav|EN-US|EN| The girls were good.
10k/wav/9336.wav|EN-US|EN| That gave us something to kick against.
10k/wav/9353.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just so sad.
10k/wav/936.wav|EN-US|EN| People tended to stay there for some time.
10k/wav/9360.wav|EN-US|EN| as I'm getting longed in the teeth.
10k/wav/9375.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no commission.
10k/wav/9376.wav|EN-US|EN| It would not have thought otherwise for one moment.
10k/wav/9408.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been a long long journey.
10k/wav/9418.wav|EN-US|EN| A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
10k/wav/9430.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it's good to turn the page.
10k/wav/9435.wav|EN-US|EN| Hurts simply. It goes something like this.
10k/wav/9436.wav|EN-US|EN| Infotable Tums, they kill Marnock our way in the black.
10k/wav/9457.wav|EN-US|EN| I will just do my best.
10k/wav/9460.wav|EN-US|EN| They could not have done more for me.
10k/wav/9477.wav|EN-US|EN| What kind of inclusion is that?
10k/wav/9483.wav|EN-US|EN| and he is the first to see that and say that.
10k/wav/949.wav|EN-US|EN| Shaken he's had, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
10k/wav/9510.wav|EN-US|EN| But it would change the context.
10k/wav/9519.wav|EN-US|EN| In the meantime, the fans would set off for a derby win.
10k/wav/9523.wav|EN-US|EN| It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the arid.
10k/wav/9532.wav|EN-US|EN| The gulls are ready to compete.
10k/wav/9534.wav|EN-US|EN| The General Secretary represents the Nieren Labour Party politics.
10k/wav/9538.wav|EN-US|EN| The record companies have gone for the fall.
10k/wav/9541.wav|EN-US|EN| next time round it will be different
10k/wav/9558.wav|EN-US|EN| These settlements are in the book.
10k/wav/9559.wav|EN-US|EN| It particularly increases underage drinking, he claimed.
10k/wav/9564.wav|EN-US|EN| If the red of the second bar falls upon the green of the fast, the result is to give a bar with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light were mixed form yellow.
10k/wav/9566.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like a high school play.
10k/wav/9575.wav|EN-US|EN| Byrne is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
10k/wav/9581.wav|EN-US|EN| I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
10k/wav/9582.wav|EN-US|EN| This will look as consumer attitudes.
10k/wav/959.wav|EN-US|EN| He has defended the system.
10k/wav/9590.wav|EN-US|EN| I told that to the police.
10k/wav/9599.wav|EN-US|EN| The snopers are all set.
10k/wav/9601.wav|EN-US|EN| Would you pay to come and see it?
10k/wav/9610.wav|EN-US|EN| Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
10k/wav/9614.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows the right amount of progress.
10k/wav/9620.wav|EN-US|EN| It was to be inclusive.
10k/wav/9629.wav|EN-US|EN| Also others were doing the same
10k/wav/9630.wav|EN-US|EN| At least two women were among their zested.
10k/wav/9632.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a party. No, no.
10k/wav/964.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the same old story.
10k/wav/9643.wav|EN-US|EN| New plot is essential for progress.
10k/wav/9666.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone at the school is delighted for Stephen.
10k/wav/9674.wav|EN-US|EN| His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
10k/wav/9682.wav|EN-US|EN| The rescue package is public money.
10k/wav/9703.wav|EN-US|EN| Nereal attempt was made to get orders.
10k/wav/9719.wav|EN-US|EN| It wouldn't go off.
10k/wav/9725.wav|EN-US|EN| Nay, is the answer to your first question?
10k/wav/9726.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very puzzled by it.
10k/wav/9731.wav|EN-US|EN| They received no money under the mudger.
10k/wav/9736.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it is going to happen.
10k/wav/975.wav|EN-US|EN| The picture is the same across Scotland.
10k/wav/9771.wav|EN-US|EN| I've got to get on with my career.
10k/wav/9774.wav|EN-US|EN| It may well have been.
10k/wav/9778.wav|EN-US|EN| The British government does not want to know.
10k/wav/978.wav|EN-US|EN| When I was training.
10k/wav/9789.wav|EN-US|EN| There were far more pressing matters to consider.
10k/wav/9792.wav|EN-US|EN| Welded employees are redundant.
10k/wav/9794.wav|EN-US|EN| Larry now intends to take a holiday.
10k/wav/9795.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not that climate cut.
10k/wav/9814.wav|EN-US|EN| It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
10k/wav/9820.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd never given up on myself.
10k/wav/9821.wav|EN-US|EN| Therefore, no one can work full time in these companies.
10k/wav/9829.wav|EN-US|EN| This was not an easy meeting for me.
10k/wav/9844.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to fail for the go.
10k/wav/9847.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a scandal, a disgrace.
10k/wav/9855.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be perfect, wouldn't it?
10k/wav/9856.wav|EN-US|EN| We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
10k/wav/9862.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
10k/wav/9879.wav|EN-US|EN| Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
10k/wav/9881.wav|EN-US|EN| Ozzy
10k/wav/9882.wav|EN-US|EN| That would end it for us.
10k/wav/9906.wav|EN-US|EN| Only four of his passengers were injured.
10k/wav/9932.wav|EN-US|EN| We told them in August.
10k/wav/9938.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm astonished. The man will not injure it.
10k/wav/9940.wav|EN-US|EN| The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, the state said.
10k/wav/9947.wav|EN-US|EN| But it will not work again.
10k/wav/9959.wav|EN-US|EN| Was everything done to save the people?
10k/wav/9971.wav|EN-US|EN| They are currently managed by in Wilson
10k/wav/9973.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a disgraceful performance.
10k/wav/9981.wav|EN-US|EN| The main thing is that they enjoy it.
10k/wav/9995.wav|EN-US|EN| We have worked hard.
10k/wav/1002.wav|EN-US|EN| We believe the world has too many refugees already.
10k/wav/1009.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly, we could go and like this all day.
10k/wav/1039.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he said the money had not been wasted
10k/wav/1048.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish it well.
10k/wav/105.wav|EN-US|EN| And the FOMI has weighed about another aspect of FOMI life.
10k/wav/1052.wav|EN-US|EN| I then just connie hid the shot.
10k/wav/1053.wav|EN-US|EN| But these were the nights.
10k/wav/1058.wav|EN-US|EN| Patterson was the man.
10k/wav/1060.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a hobby place.
10k/wav/1078.wav|EN-US|EN| Mentally, you have to be tough.
10k/wav/1086.wav|EN-US|EN| Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
10k/wav/1089.wav|EN-US|EN| They've been here before.
10k/wav/1091.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted at mate's appointment.
10k/wav/1105.wav|EN-US|EN| Our position is quite simple.
10k/wav/1106.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm glad I wasn't in it.
10k/wav/1107.wav|EN-US|EN| This is as bad as it gets.
10k/wav/1113.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't want to use the term.
10k/wav/1146.wav|EN-US|EN| Plow also had a penalty.
10k/wav/1155.wav|EN-US|EN| The lot should be changed.
10k/wav/1158.wav|EN-US|EN| We are just happy that hasn't happened.
10k/wav/1161.wav|EN-US|EN| They had a confession.
10k/wav/1164.wav|EN-US|EN| Child benefit will not be affected.
10k/wav/1170.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
10k/wav/1189.wav|EN-US|EN| It is nice to her.
10k/wav/1195.wav|EN-US|EN| To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
10k/wav/1220.wav|EN-US|EN| However, that could also fall in the latest case.
10k/wav/1221.wav|EN-US|EN| Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
10k/wav/1234.wav|EN-US|EN| We are on a 40 year mission.
10k/wav/124.wav|EN-US|EN| Is she in trouble?
10k/wav/1254.wav|EN-US|EN| Pin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
10k/wav/1259.wav|EN-US|EN| That is to miss the point.
10k/wav/1263.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going to Newbourn Field to win.
10k/wav/1265.wav|EN-US|EN| We told them in July.
10k/wav/1278.wav|EN-US|EN| The timing is round.
10k/wav/1288.wav|EN-US|EN| We want immediate action.
10k/wav/1293.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you alright?
10k/wav/1296.wav|EN-US|EN| And this came as all about belief.
10k/wav/1298.wav|EN-US|EN| Now we are back on top of Europe.
10k/wav/130.wav|EN-US|EN| That investment has now been secured.
10k/wav/131.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be easy to think, sir.
10k/wav/1310.wav|EN-US|EN| The memory is there.
10k/wav/1341.wav|EN-US|EN| Well the people thought that he would die.
10k/wav/1348.wav|EN-US|EN| How does it all work?
10k/wav/1349.wav|EN-US|EN| We haven't been told.
10k/wav/1358.wav|EN-US|EN| No one is a winner in this.
10k/wav/1359.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not too late to get on board.
10k/wav/1368.wav|EN-US|EN| Maki was at home, unable to watch.
10k/wav/1369.wav|EN-US|EN| He was prepared for this.
10k/wav/137.wav|EN-US|EN| This has been fantastic!
10k/wav/1389.wav|EN-US|EN| Part of Johnny was found some days after.
10k/wav/1401.wav|EN-US|EN| The second goal was a terrible mistake by a defence.
10k/wav/1405.wav|EN-US|EN| Hear what they have to say.
10k/wav/1416.wav|EN-US|EN| His secretary said it was a matter for my financial to deal with.
10k/wav/1435.wav|EN-US|EN| We've still got to say this.
10k/wav/1443.wav|EN-US|EN| The search is due to be completed today.
10k/wav/1445.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone agrees with that.
10k/wav/1455.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a very talented player.
10k/wav/1468.wav|EN-US|EN| He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
10k/wav/1491.wav|EN-US|EN| There is good quality.
10k/wav/1494.wav|EN-US|EN| Are they going to work together again?
10k/wav/1498.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is this?
10k/wav/1504.wav|EN-US|EN| We need nothing about it.
10k/wav/1524.wav|EN-US|EN| But they are a good team.
10k/wav/1528.wav|EN-US|EN| They also intend to travel today.
10k/wav/1558.wav|EN-US|EN| They don't have tea, but they normally do.
10k/wav/156.wav|EN-US|EN| He finished the night in a cell.
10k/wav/1562.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it does not tell the full story.
10k/wav/1563.wav|EN-US|EN| It is simple but profound.
10k/wav/1570.wav|EN-US|EN| The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
10k/wav/1576.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course I was tempted.
10k/wav/1577.wav|EN-US|EN| This area is perfect for children.
10k/wav/1583.wav|EN-US|EN| They should be swept away.
10k/wav/1597.wav|EN-US|EN| She's got to say something.
10k/wav/1599.wav|EN-US|EN| We have very real concerns about it.
10k/wav/1645.wav|EN-US|EN| What for you no good at?
10k/wav/1672.wav|EN-US|EN| But we are on none sight.
10k/wav/1682.wav|EN-US|EN| The referee faces a massive jump.
10k/wav/1685.wav|EN-US|EN| This time it might be for real.
10k/wav/17.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Blur was ready for him.
10k/wav/1717.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought it was their new out.
10k/wav/1741.wav|EN-US|EN| Singing is my first love.
10k/wav/1746.wav|EN-US|EN| So, we have to go back.
10k/wav/1782.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a furry toe.
10k/wav/1783.wav|EN-US|EN| Half the young people had had contact with the police.
10k/wav/1821.wav|EN-US|EN| The door is open.
10k/wav/184.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything will fall into place. It should be fine.
10k/wav/1844.wav|EN-US|EN| I was consent with the way they tried to justify his actions.
10k/wav/1849.wav|EN-US|EN| It is quite a new prescription.
10k/wav/1858.wav|EN-US|EN| North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
10k/wav/1863.wav|EN-US|EN| I just cut into the ball a bit.
10k/wav/1864.wav|EN-US|EN| My mother is very white.
10k/wav/1873.wav|EN-US|EN| What are the likely solutions?
10k/wav/1887.wav|EN-US|EN| It can be halted.
10k/wav/1890.wav|EN-US|EN| Surely the panel was interested.
10k/wav/1895.wav|EN-US|EN| They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
10k/wav/1915.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think there's going to be one.
10k/wav/1924.wav|EN-US|EN| We are obviously disturbed by this case.
10k/wav/1941.wav|EN-US|EN| She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
10k/wav/1943.wav|EN-US|EN| And it was great for me.
10k/wav/1946.wav|EN-US|EN| The judge said
10k/wav/1947.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be difficult to argue with that.
10k/wav/1952.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the whole package.
10k/wav/1954.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe Phillipine referees will provide the answer.
10k/wav/1969.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never been a member of the council.
10k/wav/197.wav|EN-US|EN| I could not believe the results.
10k/wav/1978.wav|EN-US|EN| The waiting game continues.
10k/wav/1997.wav|EN-US|EN| I've seen some of the submissions.
10k/wav/2011.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to be long term commitment.
10k/wav/2012.wav|EN-US|EN| He would just say it was terrible.
10k/wav/2018.wav|EN-US|EN| He was a member of the Titan army.
10k/wav/2033.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just above the roof.
10k/wav/2041.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been a great evening for us.
10k/wav/2053.wav|EN-US|EN| This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
10k/wav/2058.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd say we should give it a rake.
10k/wav/2076.wav|EN-US|EN| The couple had one daughter.
10k/wav/2083.wav|EN-US|EN| It only increased the support for him.
10k/wav/2084.wav|EN-US|EN| I was delighted with the way he jumped.
10k/wav/2092.wav|EN-US|EN| That's always the case, isn't it?
10k/wav/2098.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to do your research.
10k/wav/2110.wav|EN-US|EN| I called it out.
10k/wav/2113.wav|EN-US|EN| It's typical of me.
10k/wav/2135.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an easy decision to come here.
10k/wav/2139.wav|EN-US|EN| So, how did this happen?
10k/wav/214.wav|EN-US|EN| I was just support at the way they portaved.
10k/wav/2141.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, it is nonsense.
10k/wav/2147.wav|EN-US|EN| The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
10k/wav/2172.wav|EN-US|EN| It is, in other words, entrapment by another name
10k/wav/2189.wav|EN-US|EN| Someone else can do the cooking that night.
10k/wav/2229.wav|EN-US|EN| However, their reaction could not have been more different
10k/wav/2240.wav|EN-US|EN| Not that he was complaining.
10k/wav/2248.wav|EN-US|EN| Quality Meets Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
10k/wav/2252.wav|EN-US|EN| We should subvert this because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
10k/wav/226.wav|EN-US|EN| Today was first class.
10k/wav/2265.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
10k/wav/227.wav|EN-US|EN| It could now be up to the courts.
10k/wav/2282.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm only ready for it now.
10k/wav/2288.wav|EN-US|EN| I told you so.
10k/wav/23.wav|EN-US|EN| Why do it?
10k/wav/2304.wav|EN-US|EN| I will go to the races
10k/wav/2306.wav|EN-US|EN| They went back to the 17th.
10k/wav/2311.wav|EN-US|EN| The next game is today.
10k/wav/2317.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Pournament.
10k/wav/2318.wav|EN-US|EN| It's in his plot.
10k/wav/2329.wav|EN-US|EN| This wasn't just a big crowd.
10k/wav/2339.wav|EN-US|EN| But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
10k/wav/2346.wav|EN-US|EN| It is annoying.
10k/wav/2359.wav|EN-US|EN| And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
10k/wav/2363.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no need for that call.
10k/wav/2381.wav|EN-US|EN| These people are now following their own unison agenda.
10k/wav/239.wav|EN-US|EN| You are going to take away my life.
10k/wav/240.wav|EN-US|EN| The pace is telling.
10k/wav/2411.wav|EN-US|EN| It is part and parcel of it.
10k/wav/2425.wav|EN-US|EN| I needed a little man in the crowd.
10k/wav/2447.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not unlike the millennium back.
10k/wav/2449.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very beautiful city.
10k/wav/2451.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a goal which came from nothing.
10k/wav/2476.wav|EN-US|EN| It's time to find a decisive bottle.
10k/wav/2479.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a drug dealer
10k/wav/2503.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the culture change in Madison.
10k/wav/2516.wav|EN-US|EN| The thanks will support us.
10k/wav/2534.wav|EN-US|EN| He is the key player in Scotland.
10k/wav/2541.wav|EN-US|EN| However, by then the damage had been done
10k/wav/2545.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to keep playing.
10k/wav/2548.wav|EN-US|EN| We are teaming very well as we are.
10k/wav/2550.wav|EN-US|EN| These take the shape of a long round arch with its paths high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
10k/wav/2554.wav|EN-US|EN| You thought it was a headache.
10k/wav/2558.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it's about time.
10k/wav/2587.wav|EN-US|EN| And so it should.
10k/wav/2591.wav|EN-US|EN| It will also take evidence from consumers.
10k/wav/2597.wav|EN-US|EN| That was something else.
10k/wav/2605.wav|EN-US|EN| Financial services also show production and new business.
10k/wav/2614.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got to deliver.
10k/wav/2626.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the hell season.
10k/wav/2627.wav|EN-US|EN| We do need to get the message it calls.
10k/wav/2638.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's not just about that.
10k/wav/2641.wav|EN-US|EN| It has paid off.
10k/wav/2643.wav|EN-US|EN| I can't get it.
10k/wav/2647.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lot to be done.
10k/wav/2657.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very tragic and traumatic.
10k/wav/2666.wav|EN-US|EN| He finished the number in the brochure.
10k/wav/2669.wav|EN-US|EN| I always said no.
10k/wav/2679.wav|EN-US|EN| The club are feeling no different today.
10k/wav/2682.wav|EN-US|EN| The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
10k/wav/2694.wav|EN-US|EN| I've put my money into this project
10k/wav/2708.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a very tragic accident
10k/wav/2710.wav|EN-US|EN| The motive for the shooting was not known.
10k/wav/2723.wav|EN-US|EN| Either not thinking about anyone else.
10k/wav/2725.wav|EN-US|EN| He is one of them.
10k/wav/2766.wav|EN-US|EN| He was packed by Downing Street.
10k/wav/277.wav|EN-US|EN| They were following his orders.
10k/wav/2776.wav|EN-US|EN| We will push.
10k/wav/2778.wav|EN-US|EN| That could be ready within another nine months.
10k/wav/2783.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the stuff of live music.
10k/wav/2787.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to tighten up.
10k/wav/2788.wav|EN-US|EN| The challenge is to win a cup.
10k/wav/2805.wav|EN-US|EN| Every aspect of our play was first-class.
10k/wav/282.wav|EN-US|EN| Six years is too long.
10k/wav/2832.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he said it would be likely to bring the chill.
10k/wav/2840.wav|EN-US|EN| We've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
10k/wav/2845.wav|EN-US|EN| They were the acts of men.
10k/wav/2872.wav|EN-US|EN| Like some others, he is still to improve himself a lot.
10k/wav/290.wav|EN-US|EN| You cannot believe a what.
10k/wav/2912.wav|EN-US|EN| There must be boundaries.
10k/wav/2918.wav|EN-US|EN| He says it often enough.
10k/wav/2922.wav|EN-US|EN| He's got to go.
10k/wav/2923.wav|EN-US|EN| We said, what do you mean?
10k/wav/2925.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going to sleep.
10k/wav/2929.wav|EN-US|EN| My mind is focused on the next 4 weeks.
10k/wav/2933.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to be looking to the future.
10k/wav/2959.wav|EN-US|EN| His commitment on the other hand is clear.
10k/wav/2965.wav|EN-US|EN| For now, though, our future is with Rangers.
10k/wav/297.wav|EN-US|EN| He is looking for a sporting challenge.
10k/wav/2982.wav|EN-US|EN| Now he's back on top again.
10k/wav/2989.wav|EN-US|EN| You have got to look at speed of response.
10k/wav/2990.wav|EN-US|EN| It could have been the side.
10k/wav/3009.wav|EN-US|EN| But he has a lifeline
10k/wav/3021.wav|EN-US|EN| then as we know too well anything can happen.
10k/wav/3040.wav|EN-US|EN| That means no more taxation by stealth.
10k/wav/3043.wav|EN-US|EN| I sent to them.
10k/wav/3045.wav|EN-US|EN| The group's increasing skill will help.
10k/wav/3046.wav|EN-US|EN| They were his words.
10k/wav/3051.wav|EN-US|EN| The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
10k/wav/3053.wav|EN-US|EN| Smuggling is an increasing problem for the government.
10k/wav/3059.wav|EN-US|EN| Workers will now be piloted on the offer.
10k/wav/3065.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to break that cycle.
10k/wav/3071.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it's awful.
10k/wav/3074.wav|EN-US|EN| That's been the case for a while.
10k/wav/3110.wav|EN-US|EN| I doubt it's alright.
10k/wav/3123.wav|EN-US|EN| And what does it cost under his pain?
10k/wav/3132.wav|EN-US|EN| as if that is an achievement.
10k/wav/3136.wav|EN-US|EN| 13 through this material, a composite for no images.
10k/wav/3138.wav|EN-US|EN| In both cases, I suffer to Fiasco.
10k/wav/3146.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel like my game has come a long way.
10k/wav/3154.wav|EN-US|EN| Their moment had come, also they said.
10k/wav/3167.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the quality of the work but counts.
10k/wav/3171.wav|EN-US|EN| We have nothing to lose.
10k/wav/3179.wav|EN-US|EN| A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
10k/wav/3194.wav|EN-US|EN| Was it the Wuff?
10k/wav/3200.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no plans to retire.
10k/wav/3202.wav|EN-US|EN| It's allowed in the rules, he said later.
10k/wav/3249.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to open up.
10k/wav/3252.wav|EN-US|EN| However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
10k/wav/326.wav|EN-US|EN| His son has been travelling with the town to know me for years.
10k/wav/3269.wav|EN-US|EN| It's getting to me.
10k/wav/3281.wav|EN-US|EN| There was only one problem, the teacher was still though.
10k/wav/3287.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope they understand that.
10k/wav/329.wav|EN-US|EN| This latter point is hugely important.
10k/wav/3293.wav|EN-US|EN| You can it to go up forever.
10k/wav/3295.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a range of employers.
10k/wav/3299.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just trying to do my job.
10k/wav/33.wav|EN-US|EN| I will turn you on this tea.
10k/wav/330.wav|EN-US|EN| The message was clear.
10k/wav/3300.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a good performance.
10k/wav/3311.wav|EN-US|EN| We are here for the long term.
10k/wav/3313.wav|EN-US|EN| He likes to talk.
10k/wav/3319.wav|EN-US|EN| With this line up, they didn't need to be
10k/wav/3324.wav|EN-US|EN| He confirmed that the document was valid.
10k/wav/333.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a critical time for football.
10k/wav/3335.wav|EN-US|EN| Last month he made his debut in Japan
10k/wav/3338.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very much respected within the group.
10k/wav/3341.wav|EN-US|EN| I have had no social life at all.
10k/wav/3355.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't mean to kill her.
10k/wav/3377.wav|EN-US|EN| He is fun but inclusive and very fair.
10k/wav/3400.wav|EN-US|EN| Ending a tenancy is the last resort.
10k/wav/3402.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very happy with life.
10k/wav/3405.wav|EN-US|EN| It was like someone had died.
10k/wav/3406.wav|EN-US|EN| That shows the strength of the stool.
10k/wav/3407.wav|EN-US|EN| In Lausanne two months, the women have achieved a lot.
10k/wav/3410.wav|EN-US|EN| Investment and quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
10k/wav/3420.wav|EN-US|EN| The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
10k/wav/3429.wav|EN-US|EN| We connect to get over it.
10k/wav/3439.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no new cases left today
10k/wav/3446.wav|EN-US|EN| That should get their attention.
10k/wav/3456.wav|EN-US|EN| The two sets are different.
10k/wav/3459.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not an escape.
10k/wav/346.wav|EN-US|EN| It has really been quite appalling.
10k/wav/3474.wav|EN-US|EN| We are keen to see truth and justice.
10k/wav/348.wav|EN-US|EN| A compromise is essential.
10k/wav/3481.wav|EN-US|EN| All of them were killed.
10k/wav/3491.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, we roll over the shop.
10k/wav/3510.wav|EN-US|EN| It plainly does not work.
10k/wav/353.wav|EN-US|EN| New Year will be very busy.
10k/wav/3531.wav|EN-US|EN| We used to live with dignity in our country.
10k/wav/354.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
10k/wav/3545.wav|EN-US|EN| So there is a very real dilemma
10k/wav/3547.wav|EN-US|EN| He had played well in that central row.
10k/wav/3549.wav|EN-US|EN| They know the truth. They really know the truth.
10k/wav/3551.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not giving up.
10k/wav/3560.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be too easy.
10k/wav/3563.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no secrets.
10k/wav/3579.wav|EN-US|EN| They forgot a mountain to climb
10k/wav/3582.wav|EN-US|EN| It could really have been a disaster.
10k/wav/3588.wav|EN-US|EN| Who else here fought?
10k/wav/360.wav|EN-US|EN| How could it not?
10k/wav/3607.wav|EN-US|EN| Obviously, Ibis is one of these.
10k/wav/3610.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been a singer.
10k/wav/3616.wav|EN-US|EN| We have now noticed.
10k/wav/3624.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither could be contacted last night.
10k/wav/3629.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole thing is the music.
10k/wav/3634.wav|EN-US|EN| Night has been eclipsed.
10k/wav/3644.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd rather have been playing.
10k/wav/3645.wav|EN-US|EN| His track record is impressive.
10k/wav/3657.wav|EN-US|EN| It is no more than a shell.
10k/wav/3668.wav|EN-US|EN| Or was it some kind of a ham?
10k/wav/3670.wav|EN-US|EN| That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.
10k/wav/3683.wav|EN-US|EN| The target is to break even by grease mist.
10k/wav/3684.wav|EN-US|EN| The team this year is going places.
10k/wav/3686.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
10k/wav/3691.wav|EN-US|EN| We roll over the place in the first half.
10k/wav/3699.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not going to forget.
10k/wav/371.wav|EN-US|EN| The law would appear to be on our side.
10k/wav/3720.wav|EN-US|EN| without talking to this.
10k/wav/3729.wav|EN-US|EN| The intelligence is way up.
10k/wav/373.wav|EN-US|EN| It can just be a cynical marketing exercise.
10k/wav/3735.wav|EN-US|EN| Who would take it now after all this?
10k/wav/3741.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
10k/wav/3754.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish that tea would get a grape.
10k/wav/377.wav|EN-US|EN| The faster milk to be successful.
10k/wav/379.wav|EN-US|EN| They have been contrast in years, certainly.
10k/wav/3791.wav|EN-US|EN| He was also a great man.
10k/wav/3797.wav|EN-US|EN| Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
10k/wav/3799.wav|EN-US|EN| And then there's the racial hassle.
10k/wav/381.wav|EN-US|EN| Now the door has opened.
10k/wav/3816.wav|EN-US|EN| Faces from the 80s
10k/wav/3835.wav|EN-US|EN| Either team will be hot.
10k/wav/384.wav|EN-US|EN| He would have been wrong.
10k/wav/3847.wav|EN-US|EN| They just have a go.
10k/wav/3865.wav|EN-US|EN| It's unlikely to be renewed.
10k/wav/3871.wav|EN-US|EN| It is reform in return for resources.
10k/wav/3893.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems a long time ago.
10k/wav/3895.wav|EN-US|EN| I have great sympathy with these people.
10k/wav/3899.wav|EN-US|EN| The Queen Mother is dead.
10k/wav/3900.wav|EN-US|EN| You can get a mortgage.
10k/wav/3907.wav|EN-US|EN| So in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
10k/wav/3916.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm afraid to say anything.
10k/wav/3925.wav|EN-US|EN| Have you been dying for a night?
10k/wav/3928.wav|EN-US|EN| He was totally without that form of fear.
10k/wav/3929.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly they had other problems.
10k/wav/3944.wav|EN-US|EN| We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
10k/wav/3947.wav|EN-US|EN| A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
10k/wav/3952.wav|EN-US|EN| We'll work for nothing.
10k/wav/3961.wav|EN-US|EN| John is very, very good.
10k/wav/3971.wav|EN-US|EN| We've been there for seven years.
10k/wav/3972.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not ready for Lennox Lewis.
10k/wav/3982.wav|EN-US|EN| The result today is an impasse.
10k/wav/3985.wav|EN-US|EN| He's right up to point.
10k/wav/3994.wav|EN-US|EN| People like to talk about these things.
10k/wav/3997.wav|EN-US|EN| We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
10k/wav/40.wav|EN-US|EN| The next month is very important.
10k/wav/400.wav|EN-US|EN| We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
10k/wav/4000.wav|EN-US|EN| The cop has come home.
10k/wav/4006.wav|EN-US|EN| There's only one team in Osho
10k/wav/401.wav|EN-US|EN| There was nowhere for him to go.
10k/wav/4011.wav|EN-US|EN| governments will have to respond.
10k/wav/4022.wav|EN-US|EN| There are no excuses.
10k/wav/4026.wav|EN-US|EN| The letters are going not today.
10k/wav/4028.wav|EN-US|EN| I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
10k/wav/4064.wav|EN-US|EN| There would be famine.
10k/wav/407.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be really pleased about this.
10k/wav/4078.wav|EN-US|EN| If they don't they should say so.
10k/wav/4084.wav|EN-US|EN| I welcome this bill.
10k/wav/4086.wav|EN-US|EN| This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
10k/wav/4087.wav|EN-US|EN| The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
10k/wav/4094.wav|EN-US|EN| Not that the occasion was without restraint.
10k/wav/4100.wav|EN-US|EN| But don't weigh just yet.
10k/wav/4108.wav|EN-US|EN| They seem to get away with it.
10k/wav/4112.wav|EN-US|EN| That is unlikely to happen.
10k/wav/4123.wav|EN-US|EN| I might get an injury very easily.
10k/wav/4128.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to go back.
10k/wav/4136.wav|EN-US|EN| What is next?
10k/wav/4139.wav|EN-US|EN| But the Promo ship is everything to us.
10k/wav/4142.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
10k/wav/4145.wav|EN-US|EN| No preference emerged.
10k/wav/4148.wav|EN-US|EN| Things don't look too good at the moment.
10k/wav/4153.wav|EN-US|EN| However, Wade Johnston is not on the menu.
10k/wav/4163.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't just the character and energy of the plane.
10k/wav/4164.wav|EN-US|EN| We were very unhappy with the incident.
10k/wav/4169.wav|EN-US|EN| They chose to side with Tara
10k/wav/4175.wav|EN-US|EN| It was looking but...
10k/wav/4200.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a terrible tragedy.
10k/wav/4221.wav|EN-US|EN| Where will the money come from?
10k/wav/4232.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never been one for complaining about the press.
10k/wav/4234.wav|EN-US|EN| I have really noticed that this week.
10k/wav/424.wav|EN-US|EN| Donald was a man with many friends.
10k/wav/4243.wav|EN-US|EN| That will be the office.
10k/wav/4257.wav|EN-US|EN| I love it here.
10k/wav/4271.wav|EN-US|EN| Walker declined to put a figure on losses.
10k/wav/4277.wav|EN-US|EN| That's just the way the game is evolving
10k/wav/4278.wav|EN-US|EN| Next league marchers. Wother well done for moon.
10k/wav/4299.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not simple.
10k/wav/4306.wav|EN-US|EN| and the art of performance is taking risks.
10k/wav/4316.wav|EN-US|EN| even if you didn't have any lines.
10k/wav/4322.wav|EN-US|EN| But do you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
10k/wav/4328.wav|EN-US|EN| War is not the action.
10k/wav/4334.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no formula.
10k/wav/4364.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a false.
10k/wav/4376.wav|EN-US|EN| It intends to do so on Wednesday.
10k/wav/4387.wav|EN-US|EN| The company still had the confidence of his bankers, he said.
10k/wav/4389.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
10k/wav/4420.wav|EN-US|EN| The important thing was to be there and to experience it.
10k/wav/4426.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a member of the lay property stuff.
10k/wav/4437.wav|EN-US|EN| Neil has worked hard throughout his career.
10k/wav/4441.wav|EN-US|EN| Womti is great in his own backyard
10k/wav/4444.wav|EN-US|EN| And we are not there yet.
10k/wav/4463.wav|EN-US|EN| The fuss came is so important.
10k/wav/4471.wav|EN-US|EN| You've got to have both sides.
10k/wav/4480.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you come from Moscow?
10k/wav/4510.wav|EN-US|EN| His job was not advertised.
10k/wav/4512.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think it's there yet.
10k/wav/4518.wav|EN-US|EN| Would it really be good to shorten it?
10k/wav/4524.wav|EN-US|EN| Those were the days.
10k/wav/4525.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a bigger advantage.
10k/wav/4534.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no happiness.
10k/wav/4548.wav|EN-US|EN| The hill says an Africa is in the group of apes.
10k/wav/4557.wav|EN-US|EN| It was magic.
10k/wav/4559.wav|EN-US|EN| These take the shape of a long round arch and its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
10k/wav/4594.wav|EN-US|EN| That's a very strong element.
10k/wav/4597.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not a fan of books.
10k/wav/460.wav|EN-US|EN| It is essential that we win the game.
10k/wav/4614.wav|EN-US|EN| I forgot to winter to be happy.
10k/wav/4616.wav|EN-US|EN| Portly, it is his own fort.
10k/wav/4620.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a hobby for me.
10k/wav/4631.wav|EN-US|EN| We call it marriage.
10k/wav/4637.wav|EN-US|EN| Have a look at this lot
10k/wav/4643.wav|EN-US|EN| Corporate Banking would be based in Edinburgh.
10k/wav/4648.wav|EN-US|EN| That perhaps is behind the problem.
10k/wav/4665.wav|EN-US|EN| Sales are falling off to days of growth.
10k/wav/4670.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to be proof out.
10k/wav/4674.wav|EN-US|EN| Let the job is far from over.
10k/wav/4683.wav|EN-US|EN| And it will be a challenge.
10k/wav/4687.wav|EN-US|EN| Our policy is very clever on this issue.
10k/wav/4694.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a fairy tale.
10k/wav/4703.wav|EN-US|EN| However, we must not be complacent.
10k/wav/4747.wav|EN-US|EN| It is so sad.
10k/wav/4758.wav|EN-US|EN| We are talking about the outskirts of London.
10k/wav/476.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be the constructive way forward.
10k/wav/4760.wav|EN-US|EN| Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
10k/wav/4767.wav|EN-US|EN| These decisions are not simple.
10k/wav/477.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no one of the required standard.
10k/wav/4770.wav|EN-US|EN| They did very well.
10k/wav/4774.wav|EN-US|EN| But nothing could be done.
10k/wav/4778.wav|EN-US|EN| I told them during their morning break.
10k/wav/4791.wav|EN-US|EN| There's no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
10k/wav/4808.wav|EN-US|EN| There can be no dispute about our history.
10k/wav/4817.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we believed that the tide was one.
10k/wav/4834.wav|EN-US|EN| We are getting people into work.
10k/wav/4838.wav|EN-US|EN| It's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
10k/wav/4844.wav|EN-US|EN| That's all I was trying to do today.
10k/wav/4853.wav|EN-US|EN| is and they would be ridiculed.
10k/wav/4857.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to prove it.
10k/wav/4904.wav|EN-US|EN| The government has completely lost control of Gempea crops.
10k/wav/491.wav|EN-US|EN| Nor should they have been.
10k/wav/4917.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to get to the final anyway.
10k/wav/4919.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought the dancing was over.
10k/wav/492.wav|EN-US|EN| At first I thought I was gone.
10k/wav/4930.wav|EN-US|EN| And that includes the Barnett formula.
10k/wav/4933.wav|EN-US|EN| He agreed with my proposal.
10k/wav/494.wav|EN-US|EN| Other casualties were voted by the swift response of the emergency services.
10k/wav/4990.wav|EN-US|EN| Weather conditions were good, he added.
10k/wav/4992.wav|EN-US|EN| This is his first movie.
10k/wav/5015.wav|EN-US|EN| They forgot more time.
10k/wav/5019.wav|EN-US|EN| We accept the challenge.
10k/wav/5029.wav|EN-US|EN| We shall rely on human beings.
10k/wav/5041.wav|EN-US|EN| I have great confidence in Unable.
10k/wav/5050.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no point in pushing it.
10k/wav/5056.wav|EN-US|EN| He has left the company.
10k/wav/5058.wav|EN-US|EN| Willie deserved it for what he has achieved.
10k/wav/5108.wav|EN-US|EN| The latter way is my way.
10k/wav/5117.wav|EN-US|EN| Shem always, the Justice Minister, acknowledged that President Umbers were concerned.
10k/wav/5118.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't enter the first game, but today they were excellent.
10k/wav/5128.wav|EN-US|EN| NATO would ensure they could return home, he said.
10k/wav/513.wav|EN-US|EN| Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
10k/wav/5139.wav|EN-US|EN| They are in care for a reason.
10k/wav/5140.wav|EN-US|EN| This might seem like a natural justice session.
10k/wav/5143.wav|EN-US|EN| So it goes on.
10k/wav/5155.wav|EN-US|EN| How many cases have there been?
10k/wav/5185.wav|EN-US|EN| I can do this on mine
10k/wav/5190.wav|EN-US|EN| It is based on his movement records.
10k/wav/5196.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the ultimate revenge.
10k/wav/5204.wav|EN-US|EN| That money could have been coming to Scotland.
10k/wav/5217.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be too hot.
10k/wav/527.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the nature of the game.
10k/wav/5295.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a time bomb.
10k/wav/5314.wav|EN-US|EN| Pit, of course, would play the lightsaber.
10k/wav/5333.wav|EN-US|EN| There changes the world of music.
10k/wav/5338.wav|EN-US|EN| I said the hell thing.
10k/wav/5355.wav|EN-US|EN| Now we look forward to it.
10k/wav/539.wav|EN-US|EN| as indeed there would be.
10k/wav/5397.wav|EN-US|EN| Britain will lead demands for the reform of Europe.
10k/wav/540.wav|EN-US|EN| He is well respected by his colleagues.
10k/wav/5409.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to think not.
10k/wav/5416.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, that is not the whole story.
10k/wav/5418.wav|EN-US|EN| A press conference is about politics.
10k/wav/5446.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be my view.
10k/wav/5457.wav|EN-US|EN| Let us welcome this.
10k/wav/5459.wav|EN-US|EN| He was sentenced to seven years.
10k/wav/546.wav|EN-US|EN| Which brings us to the question of money.
10k/wav/5482.wav|EN-US|EN| We don't want to push him.
10k/wav/5483.wav|EN-US|EN| You must always attempt to raise the bar.
10k/wav/5485.wav|EN-US|EN| He was a huge success story.
10k/wav/5496.wav|EN-US|EN| Most of the works are small at scale.
10k/wav/5507.wav|EN-US|EN| No's not the moment to leave.
10k/wav/5513.wav|EN-US|EN| I seem to keep this for the majors.
10k/wav/5520.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday he had a chilling warning for the Cayman Scotland.
10k/wav/5546.wav|EN-US|EN| His team management was protective.
10k/wav/5593.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to put myself on the line.
10k/wav/5600.wav|EN-US|EN| It was quite distressing for the crew.
10k/wav/5619.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't detect that view.
10k/wav/5623.wav|EN-US|EN| It looks that way.
10k/wav/563.wav|EN-US|EN| Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
10k/wav/5631.wav|EN-US|EN| We've had an enjoyable adventure.
10k/wav/5638.wav|EN-US|EN| They wouldn't actually make any money from it.
10k/wav/564.wav|EN-US|EN| Look at the witnesses.
10k/wav/5647.wav|EN-US|EN| You look at them and you understand.
10k/wav/5649.wav|EN-US|EN| Washington is consumed by the crisis.
10k/wav/5652.wav|EN-US|EN| A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
10k/wav/5662.wav|EN-US|EN| May Johnston will replace it.
10k/wav/5668.wav|EN-US|EN| I will need to discuss it with my family.
10k/wav/5676.wav|EN-US|EN| if you could find it.
10k/wav/5681.wav|EN-US|EN| It was too difficult.
10k/wav/5683.wav|EN-US|EN| I will never see my son again.
10k/wav/569.wav|EN-US|EN| There were too many mistakes.
10k/wav/5696.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't say there was a massacre.
10k/wav/5709.wav|EN-US|EN| Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
10k/wav/5718.wav|EN-US|EN| He did an amist.
10k/wav/5731.wav|EN-US|EN| We are now looking with further time of future project.
10k/wav/5738.wav|EN-US|EN| Family members are at her bedside.
10k/wav/5756.wav|EN-US|EN| Frankly it was disgusting.
10k/wav/5787.wav|EN-US|EN| Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
10k/wav/5792.wav|EN-US|EN| Then one night only three people turn up.
10k/wav/5813.wav|EN-US|EN| We gave them the goal.
10k/wav/5818.wav|EN-US|EN| Subcity income will not be affected.
10k/wav/5830.wav|EN-US|EN| I would not do that.
10k/wav/5839.wav|EN-US|EN| They were both very brave.
10k/wav/5852.wav|EN-US|EN| It should be devolved.
10k/wav/5853.wav|EN-US|EN| Rotecilas will start in the near for the extended season.
10k/wav/5856.wav|EN-US|EN| People have a wish to charge twice.
10k/wav/5872.wav|EN-US|EN| But is it ethical to practice in the humans?
10k/wav/5891.wav|EN-US|EN| with the NOT travel agents.
10k/wav/59.wav|EN-US|EN| I always felt they played for me.
10k/wav/5900.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been overwhelmed by the response.
10k/wav/5904.wav|EN-US|EN| That is how it will be judged.
10k/wav/5916.wav|EN-US|EN| That view has not altered.
10k/wav/5924.wav|EN-US|EN| They were fantastic.
10k/wav/5926.wav|EN-US|EN| We will see how he is.
10k/wav/593.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a common problem.
10k/wav/5935.wav|EN-US|EN| The script was funny.
10k/wav/5944.wav|EN-US|EN| She had denied the charge.
10k/wav/5956.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a step backwards.
10k/wav/5960.wav|EN-US|EN| They did not threaten anyone.
10k/wav/5962.wav|EN-US|EN| The Scottish prison service said it could not comment on the visit.
10k/wav/5975.wav|EN-US|EN| Some reports said they have been killed.
10k/wav/5978.wav|EN-US|EN| At the same time it is a Sato
10k/wav/5985.wav|EN-US|EN| Construction is due to begin in February.
10k/wav/5987.wav|EN-US|EN| He also worked on channel building contracts in the area.
10k/wav/5992.wav|EN-US|EN| To then, is going to be captain of Europe.
10k/wav/6018.wav|EN-US|EN| He was also very happy to listen.
10k/wav/6033.wav|EN-US|EN| We told them in June.
10k/wav/6053.wav|EN-US|EN| You make the choice.
10k/wav/6061.wav|EN-US|EN| As our national coach, Brian is done for.
10k/wav/6068.wav|EN-US|EN| I isn't just a regular person.
10k/wav/6099.wav|EN-US|EN| Here is the weather forecast for the weekend.
10k/wav/6100.wav|EN-US|EN| They were making excuses for him.
10k/wav/6101.wav|EN-US|EN| I learned that only yesterday.
10k/wav/6106.wav|EN-US|EN| They could go no further forward.
10k/wav/6114.wav|EN-US|EN| There are school plays in uniform.
10k/wav/6116.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm looking forward to it.
10k/wav/6117.wav|EN-US|EN| They are the carries.
10k/wav/6129.wav|EN-US|EN| Such people do not exist.
10k/wav/6133.wav|EN-US|EN| This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
10k/wav/6138.wav|EN-US|EN| It's no less intriguing, however.
10k/wav/6141.wav|EN-US|EN| I am secure in my own position
10k/wav/6151.wav|EN-US|EN| I know you went back this morning.
10k/wav/6155.wav|EN-US|EN| I will not be awake, however.
10k/wav/6172.wav|EN-US|EN| People will see this over time.
10k/wav/6178.wav|EN-US|EN| I would ask the fans to be patient.
10k/wav/6179.wav|EN-US|EN| I then limit him 3 times.
10k/wav/6184.wav|EN-US|EN| They've a kind of narrative.
10k/wav/6202.wav|EN-US|EN| All were believed to be adults.
10k/wav/6203.wav|EN-US|EN| They will be destroyed.
10k/wav/6207.wav|EN-US|EN| Wodendevich
10k/wav/6230.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is that?
10k/wav/6235.wav|EN-US|EN| Alex has been of each influence on the club.
10k/wav/6252.wav|EN-US|EN| Thunting would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland
10k/wav/6254.wav|EN-US|EN| I still think you will win.
10k/wav/626.wav|EN-US|EN| Because they didn't want to know.
10k/wav/6261.wav|EN-US|EN| Things are on track.
10k/wav/6264.wav|EN-US|EN| Alan is strong in every shape and form.
10k/wav/6268.wav|EN-US|EN| He was really great.
10k/wav/6270.wav|EN-US|EN| No decisions have been taken.
10k/wav/6281.wav|EN-US|EN| But it failed.
10k/wav/6293.wav|EN-US|EN| It has happened for generations.
10k/wav/6297.wav|EN-US|EN| That proved enough to settle the home side down.
10k/wav/6318.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be tight.
10k/wav/6319.wav|EN-US|EN| People come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
10k/wav/633.wav|EN-US|EN| We are too easily beaten as a team.
10k/wav/6347.wav|EN-US|EN| Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophils.
10k/wav/6348.wav|EN-US|EN| He has a lot of skill.
10k/wav/6357.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
10k/wav/6370.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not been a good year.
10k/wav/6374.wav|EN-US|EN| Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
10k/wav/6392.wav|EN-US|EN| We will see how he is off to treatment.
10k/wav/6405.wav|EN-US|EN| Now the plot is perfect.
10k/wav/6406.wav|EN-US|EN| The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
10k/wav/6411.wav|EN-US|EN| and lead the bomber was killed
10k/wav/6417.wav|EN-US|EN| He was different from the rest of us.
10k/wav/6436.wav|EN-US|EN| But she might be.
10k/wav/6447.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps then is something we didn't.
10k/wav/6460.wav|EN-US|EN| He asked me how they were doing.
10k/wav/6461.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the real thing for sure.
10k/wav/6467.wav|EN-US|EN| Who did it doesn't really matter.
10k/wav/6474.wav|EN-US|EN| The fifth was found later.
10k/wav/6502.wav|EN-US|EN| It was frightening, intense and primal theatre.
10k/wav/6507.wav|EN-US|EN| In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
10k/wav/6508.wav|EN-US|EN| Anyone can still win this tournament.
10k/wav/6513.wav|EN-US|EN| He was telling me to keep quiet.
10k/wav/6518.wav|EN-US|EN| Itron has its own system.
10k/wav/6538.wav|EN-US|EN| We have big ideas.
10k/wav/6551.wav|EN-US|EN| Here we have not had one, though.
10k/wav/6557.wav|EN-US|EN| The Scottish Socialist Party is also expected to attend.
10k/wav/6561.wav|EN-US|EN| History is made at the Masters.
10k/wav/6562.wav|EN-US|EN| I was fast in the door.
10k/wav/6577.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone needs a holiday, even the salvation on me.
10k/wav/6578.wav|EN-US|EN| A teacher is really about unity.
10k/wav/6580.wav|EN-US|EN| He was at the game, and he is indeed.
10k/wav/6600.wav|EN-US|EN| The decision was designed to shock investors.
10k/wav/6610.wav|EN-US|EN| But his speech was delivered by senior civil servant.
10k/wav/6625.wav|EN-US|EN| It turned out to have been three hours
10k/wav/6627.wav|EN-US|EN| The feeling between the two men was mutual.
10k/wav/6631.wav|EN-US|EN| They cultivate to keep it together.
10k/wav/6632.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a good player.
10k/wav/6646.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the first job of the Director of Leadership.
10k/wav/6659.wav|EN-US|EN| It is good for our team.
10k/wav/6667.wav|EN-US|EN| I can live here without a problem.
10k/wav/669.wav|EN-US|EN| They are also exploited by the markets.
10k/wav/6694.wav|EN-US|EN| What happened in this instance is there is misconduct.
10k/wav/6707.wav|EN-US|EN| This is my big break.
10k/wav/6708.wav|EN-US|EN| We will treat it like a world cop match.
10k/wav/6709.wav|EN-US|EN| She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
10k/wav/6711.wav|EN-US|EN| The outcome is no nine, Hans.
10k/wav/6715.wav|EN-US|EN| Defeat is simply not an option.
10k/wav/6718.wav|EN-US|EN| The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
10k/wav/6724.wav|EN-US|EN| At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
10k/wav/6726.wav|EN-US|EN| They control the prices paid to farmers.
10k/wav/6728.wav|EN-US|EN| We're done to see it is done grading.
10k/wav/6743.wav|EN-US|EN| I know my job.
10k/wav/6755.wav|EN-US|EN| It is never an easy game.
10k/wav/676.wav|EN-US|EN| What's Sid got to do with them anyway?
10k/wav/6760.wav|EN-US|EN| They are with their father.
10k/wav/6774.wav|EN-US|EN| In Glasgow, Sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
10k/wav/6811.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a horrible moment.
10k/wav/6817.wav|EN-US|EN| He will have to live with his words.
10k/wav/6824.wav|EN-US|EN| I had relied on him.
10k/wav/6837.wav|EN-US|EN| Yet there is hope.
10k/wav/6838.wav|EN-US|EN| They've got to account for it.
10k/wav/6841.wav|EN-US|EN| I haven't this pickin' to anyone about that. Not even Moaf.
10k/wav/6852.wav|EN-US|EN| We will win the argument.
10k/wav/6861.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be a miracle.
10k/wav/6863.wav|EN-US|EN| Czech Midkonor will be making a statement tomorrow.
10k/wav/6876.wav|EN-US|EN| She is obviously very disappointed.
10k/wav/6879.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very unfair and something should be done.
10k/wav/6889.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
10k/wav/69.wav|EN-US|EN| It is par for the course, isn't it?
10k/wav/690.wav|EN-US|EN| What are sorted?
10k/wav/6904.wav|EN-US|EN| We played too deeply.
10k/wav/6905.wav|EN-US|EN| It's nothing to do with me.
10k/wav/692.wav|EN-US|EN| He is not a team captain.
10k/wav/6925.wav|EN-US|EN| But someone has to take them.
10k/wav/6930.wav|EN-US|EN| I can inter-remember a lot about the accident.
10k/wav/6931.wav|EN-US|EN| It may also be her last.
10k/wav/696.wav|EN-US|EN| I had some back playing football, which is what it's all about.
10k/wav/6961.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very disturbing picture for men.
10k/wav/6966.wav|EN-US|EN| Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
10k/wav/6977.wav|EN-US|EN| They did not interfere.
10k/wav/6984.wav|EN-US|EN| His funeral is not expected until next week.
10k/wav/6986.wav|EN-US|EN| There's nothing for the kids.
10k/wav/6997.wav|EN-US|EN| The value of the magic is told there.
10k/wav/702.wav|EN-US|EN| Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
10k/wav/7032.wav|EN-US|EN| It is an art rich.
10k/wav/7035.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the snow was welcomed by some.
10k/wav/7039.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just not good enough.
10k/wav/7090.wav|EN-US|EN| Here's a joy to watch.
10k/wav/7101.wav|EN-US|EN| I certainly will not settle.
10k/wav/7104.wav|EN-US|EN| A labour insider said it was far too clear as to call.
10k/wav/7119.wav|EN-US|EN| The only safe investment is cash.
10k/wav/7155.wav|EN-US|EN| Altman has every right to be bitter.
10k/wav/7157.wav|EN-US|EN| It does not work that way in Scottish football.
10k/wav/7166.wav|EN-US|EN| First and foremost the game is entirely different.
10k/wav/7167.wav|EN-US|EN| However, ruling will not come before next week.
10k/wav/7180.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it seems that you got it wrong.
10k/wav/7186.wav|EN-US|EN| Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
10k/wav/7199.wav|EN-US|EN| That is why it is so lyrical.
10k/wav/7202.wav|EN-US|EN| It's good to have a voice.
10k/wav/7213.wav|EN-US|EN| Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
10k/wav/7223.wav|EN-US|EN| It's harder, believe me.
10k/wav/7227.wav|EN-US|EN| The money will go straight to the manager.
10k/wav/7239.wav|EN-US|EN| We got some very well.
10k/wav/7242.wav|EN-US|EN| We are a service industry.
10k/wav/7249.wav|EN-US|EN| He's been the key to everything.
10k/wav/7256.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never thought a role that you could be too young.
10k/wav/726.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't know if people would turn up.
10k/wav/7265.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just another race and yesterday is history.
10k/wav/7274.wav|EN-US|EN| Her father had died recently.
10k/wav/7283.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
10k/wav/7288.wav|EN-US|EN| That's had never happened.
10k/wav/7296.wav|EN-US|EN| It was one in the afternoon.
10k/wav/7309.wav|EN-US|EN| You sure didn't have a stoppage in November.
10k/wav/7323.wav|EN-US|EN| And it's not funny.
10k/wav/7325.wav|EN-US|EN| We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
10k/wav/7334.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone had to play the game.
10k/wav/7339.wav|EN-US|EN| Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
10k/wav/7341.wav|EN-US|EN| We shall be ready for Ranges.
10k/wav/7353.wav|EN-US|EN| I still hope to go.
10k/wav/7354.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no internal damage.
10k/wav/7355.wav|EN-US|EN| He will have it within two weeks.
10k/wav/7357.wav|EN-US|EN| It is vital that the government gets this right.
10k/wav/7361.wav|EN-US|EN| It was man against boys.
10k/wav/7372.wav|EN-US|EN| I've behead the time of my oath.
10k/wav/7379.wav|EN-US|EN| This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
10k/wav/7381.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't know there was anything around.
10k/wav/741.wav|EN-US|EN| He had done his homework properly.
10k/wav/7412.wav|EN-US|EN| For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
10k/wav/743.wav|EN-US|EN| It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
10k/wav/7430.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a great respect for her.
10k/wav/7449.wav|EN-US|EN| You can be sure we will have problems.
10k/wav/7453.wav|EN-US|EN| and they'll have a vote.
10k/wav/7477.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is our picture.
10k/wav/7501.wav|EN-US|EN| In London today, it was business as usual.
10k/wav/751.wav|EN-US|EN| They would have looked out for each other.
10k/wav/7524.wav|EN-US|EN| Charges against the power were found not proven.
10k/wav/753.wav|EN-US|EN| I try to be open to experience.
10k/wav/7535.wav|EN-US|EN| Disruption will be capped to minimum.
10k/wav/7542.wav|EN-US|EN| It's good news.
10k/wav/7551.wav|EN-US|EN| Here the picture is broadly stable.
10k/wav/7553.wav|EN-US|EN| The money is not really her concern.
10k/wav/7554.wav|EN-US|EN| This will have no effect on the championship.
10k/wav/7555.wav|EN-US|EN| He will not be coming back.
10k/wav/7558.wav|EN-US|EN| We are under no illusions about this.
10k/wav/7560.wav|EN-US|EN| There were two different types.
10k/wav/7563.wav|EN-US|EN| She has always been very friendly.
10k/wav/7565.wav|EN-US|EN| You cannot understand it until you experience it.
10k/wav/7566.wav|EN-US|EN| This has a multitude of purposes.
10k/wav/7570.wav|EN-US|EN| Their findings are published in the journal Injury Prevention.
10k/wav/7577.wav|EN-US|EN| Butcher has only one idea in mind.
10k/wav/7593.wav|EN-US|EN| However, this isn't neither start.
10k/wav/7611.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
10k/wav/7622.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a month ago.
10k/wav/763.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very lucky no one was killed.
10k/wav/7658.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
10k/wav/7662.wav|EN-US|EN| But the battle has only just begun.
10k/wav/7663.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a new one caveat.
10k/wav/7682.wav|EN-US|EN| The enemy was time.
10k/wav/7687.wav|EN-US|EN| This could put pressure on like inflation.
10k/wav/7698.wav|EN-US|EN| From there it was a success story.
10k/wav/77.wav|EN-US|EN| But there is no eye contact.
10k/wav/7700.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish it well for the future.
10k/wav/7707.wav|EN-US|EN| Housing is in very short supply.
10k/wav/771.wav|EN-US|EN| I was embarrassed by it.
10k/wav/7711.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very happy with the verdict.
10k/wav/7716.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to be a long-term commitment.
10k/wav/7719.wav|EN-US|EN| He asked me in a towing sand.
10k/wav/7725.wav|EN-US|EN| Stuckers are capable of killing.
10k/wav/7727.wav|EN-US|EN| Odysseus decisions were taken early on.
10k/wav/775.wav|EN-US|EN| focusing is a good example
10k/wav/7758.wav|EN-US|EN| That's what makes it interesting.
10k/wav/7774.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to win so badly.
10k/wav/7775.wav|EN-US|EN| It is my fault.
10k/wav/7785.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very happy to be here.
10k/wav/7793.wav|EN-US|EN| The shop is near it before city investors did.
10k/wav/7796.wav|EN-US|EN| I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
10k/wav/7797.wav|EN-US|EN| I said at the time it was wrong.
10k/wav/7810.wav|EN-US|EN| Life has been turned upside down.
10k/wav/7823.wav|EN-US|EN| Our strategy is straight forward.
10k/wav/7830.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a real challenge.
10k/wav/7844.wav|EN-US|EN| Weck tiresome went to prison.
10k/wav/788.wav|EN-US|EN| The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
10k/wav/7890.wav|EN-US|EN| But it won't make a difference.
10k/wav/7893.wav|EN-US|EN| I do not want to wait until May.
10k/wav/7898.wav|EN-US|EN| The pollution and the thriving are beyond belief.
10k/wav/790.wav|EN-US|EN| Tarny Street also rejected the calls for an European army.
10k/wav/7902.wav|EN-US|EN| Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland
10k/wav/7923.wav|EN-US|EN| Gas production was also at record levels last year.
10k/wav/7926.wav|EN-US|EN| People acted too quickly.
10k/wav/7933.wav|EN-US|EN| She is deeply distressed.
10k/wav/7934.wav|EN-US|EN| The following year was a miserable time for Mr Ture.
10k/wav/7961.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is the structure?
10k/wav/7981.wav|EN-US|EN| We knew they could do it.
10k/wav/7982.wav|EN-US|EN| I will carry on.
10k/wav/7995.wav|EN-US|EN| A short list is to be drawn up next month.
10k/wav/7998.wav|EN-US|EN| It is like a football team.
10k/wav/80.wav|EN-US|EN| For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
10k/wav/8030.wav|EN-US|EN| It need not be like that.
10k/wav/807.wav|EN-US|EN| Are you the man from the Herald?
10k/wav/8082.wav|EN-US|EN| Well term, it was the right thing to do.
10k/wav/8097.wav|EN-US|EN| And therein does the problem.
10k/wav/8103.wav|EN-US|EN| He was very fit.
10k/wav/8121.wav|EN-US|EN| I was established by this decision
10k/wav/8134.wav|EN-US|EN| Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
10k/wav/8156.wav|EN-US|EN| Alfaro presents an attractive price for the business.
10k/wav/8168.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, it could not be done.
10k/wav/8194.wav|EN-US|EN| However, on this chain it's going to be a difficult task.
10k/wav/8199.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been treated with complete contempt.
10k/wav/8211.wav|EN-US|EN| I came up through the ranks.
10k/wav/8224.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone knew the family.
10k/wav/8230.wav|EN-US|EN| Major is a major.
10k/wav/8245.wav|EN-US|EN| We can play better than that.
10k/wav/825.wav|EN-US|EN| The both are very confident.
10k/wav/8268.wav|EN-US|EN| That is where the damage has been done.
10k/wav/8275.wav|EN-US|EN| Part of England is not.
10k/wav/8282.wav|EN-US|EN| I've already got this.
10k/wav/8288.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very much in our thoughts.
10k/wav/8294.wav|EN-US|EN| Now it is measuring it in dollars.
10k/wav/83.wav|EN-US|EN| The market is important for initial public offerings.
10k/wav/8314.wav|EN-US|EN| Behind him was his brother.
10k/wav/832.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
10k/wav/8329.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
10k/wav/8348.wav|EN-US|EN| No one wants to go through these things.
10k/wav/8364.wav|EN-US|EN| It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
10k/wav/838.wav|EN-US|EN| Some would say that that culture have been created already.
10k/wav/8385.wav|EN-US|EN| I would not want to be famous for nothing.
10k/wav/8389.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a virus.
10k/wav/8390.wav|EN-US|EN| No contact was made although the arm was clearly raised.
10k/wav/8403.wav|EN-US|EN| They should have some measure of protection.
10k/wav/8422.wav|EN-US|EN| This was not just in Congress.
10k/wav/8428.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Wilson has received no such request.
10k/wav/8430.wav|EN-US|EN| That it is a brand name.
10k/wav/8451.wav|EN-US|EN| Now he is back on top again.
10k/wav/8453.wav|EN-US|EN| If he could have prevented it happening he would have.
10k/wav/8456.wav|EN-US|EN| It has moved on in the last week.
10k/wav/8461.wav|EN-US|EN| She had experience of the worldest places.
10k/wav/8480.wav|EN-US|EN| It was clearly not a battle.
10k/wav/8486.wav|EN-US|EN| So what is the campaign about?
10k/wav/8488.wav|EN-US|EN| It is based on population rather than need.
10k/wav/8494.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope that that will be forthcoming.
10k/wav/8502.wav|EN-US|EN| He does not much like the liberal Democrats.
10k/wav/8509.wav|EN-US|EN| My first Anuvius wish is for him to change his mind.
10k/wav/8518.wav|EN-US|EN| It sounds like an important tragic incident
10k/wav/8552.wav|EN-US|EN| It offers a different viewpoint.
10k/wav/8553.wav|EN-US|EN| You will not feel a thing.
10k/wav/8554.wav|EN-US|EN| Its feature isn't set in.
10k/wav/8559.wav|EN-US|EN| This is truly a field of miracles.
10k/wav/8570.wav|EN-US|EN| So she told him
10k/wav/8572.wav|EN-US|EN| Next week, Marchas. Abadinfthamti.
10k/wav/8576.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a job creation scheme.
10k/wav/8598.wav|EN-US|EN| There seemed to be, anyway.
10k/wav/8610.wav|EN-US|EN| They would love to do more films.
10k/wav/8617.wav|EN-US|EN| They are just trying to cover up
10k/wav/8619.wav|EN-US|EN| It ignores the future.
10k/wav/862.wav|EN-US|EN| So not this series has had its day.
10k/wav/8636.wav|EN-US|EN| She was always a quality act.
10k/wav/8661.wav|EN-US|EN| And seeing it then we may think.
10k/wav/8667.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a very terrible thing.
10k/wav/8678.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an amazing landscape.
10k/wav/8691.wav|EN-US|EN| I was the Welling Journeyman.
10k/wav/8703.wav|EN-US|EN| I'll say it with a pair
10k/wav/8709.wav|EN-US|EN| Treasuries' Pixelman Malcolm Pros is also considered a potential contender.
10k/wav/8711.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
10k/wav/8713.wav|EN-US|EN| It is rubbish.
10k/wav/8723.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish sport was not mentioned.
10k/wav/8733.wav|EN-US|EN| Is the war over?
10k/wav/8740.wav|EN-US|EN| Who's going to be panellised?
10k/wav/8749.wav|EN-US|EN| Do I have a favourite?
10k/wav/8750.wav|EN-US|EN| However the report was incorrect.
10k/wav/8751.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know why you say goodbye.
10k/wav/8768.wav|EN-US|EN| What are you not good at?
10k/wav/8774.wav|EN-US|EN| Hot cash is needed now.
10k/wav/8790.wav|EN-US|EN| Me spent the only part of this career elsewhere.
10k/wav/8802.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe you could have turned it down.
10k/wav/8805.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been here for a neat three months.
10k/wav/8817.wav|EN-US|EN| The first time it was rejected.
10k/wav/8821.wav|EN-US|EN| He released a half dozen SO albums.
10k/wav/885.wav|EN-US|EN| That is part of athletics.
10k/wav/8856.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be no final dividend.
10k/wav/8878.wav|EN-US|EN| The difference was amazing.
10k/wav/8891.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a wonderful hollow for me.
10k/wav/8895.wav|EN-US|EN| She will attend in July.
10k/wav/8899.wav|EN-US|EN| When will this change?
10k/wav/8926.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be paying agency rates.
10k/wav/8937.wav|EN-US|EN| The second half was a different affair.
10k/wav/8954.wav|EN-US|EN| I had it before the final.
10k/wav/8971.wav|EN-US|EN| Do they play for the money?
10k/wav/8972.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope we do.
10k/wav/8981.wav|EN-US|EN| The butcher is very good.
10k/wav/8988.wav|EN-US|EN| Police are appearing for witnesses to the accident.
10k/wav/899.wav|EN-US|EN| And that is the bottom line Pox offers.
10k/wav/8993.wav|EN-US|EN| The regional government faces key elections ex-May.
10k/wav/8995.wav|EN-US|EN| The dream is as cold as they come.
10k/wav/8999.wav|EN-US|EN| I would love to play in Europe again.
10k/wav/90.wav|EN-US|EN| A European fellow must speed the millennium target.
10k/wav/9013.wav|EN-US|EN| They had better be.
10k/wav/9020.wav|EN-US|EN| He will not be involved in school discipline.
10k/wav/9021.wav|EN-US|EN| That she is one of the lucky ones.
10k/wav/903.wav|EN-US|EN| No, we were not exactly favourites.
10k/wav/9049.wav|EN-US|EN| That is very important to people.
10k/wav/9057.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no escape.
10k/wav/906.wav|EN-US|EN| IWAF and family are the support system.
10k/wav/9082.wav|EN-US|EN| They would do nothing for the local people.
10k/wav/9099.wav|EN-US|EN| Whoever said that, can it have seen it?
10k/wav/910.wav|EN-US|EN| The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods pass from earth to their home in the sky.
10k/wav/9105.wav|EN-US|EN| Stan is a vital part of our future.
10k/wav/9137.wav|EN-US|EN| From our point of view, the play was free to leave.
10k/wav/9140.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a stunning try from John.
10k/wav/9143.wav|EN-US|EN| The concept is simple.
10k/wav/9147.wav|EN-US|EN| And the newspapers were full of it.
10k/wav/9154.wav|EN-US|EN| The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
10k/wav/9161.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't know why they were.
10k/wav/9184.wav|EN-US|EN| Why does he do it?
10k/wav/9186.wav|EN-US|EN| Some things in life we have to accept.
10k/wav/9228.wav|EN-US|EN| What on earth has happened it to Ruckby?
10k/wav/9232.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, we want to go home.
10k/wav/9247.wav|EN-US|EN| That means an extra two years.
10k/wav/9253.wav|EN-US|EN| Shaki is passionate about Scotland.
10k/wav/926.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not true.
10k/wav/9279.wav|EN-US|EN| We may make a short term appointment.
10k/wav/9288.wav|EN-US|EN| What's the name in this? The Age of the Internet.
10k/wav/9292.wav|EN-US|EN| He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
10k/wav/9299.wav|EN-US|EN| His third goal was to pup.
10k/wav/9318.wav|EN-US|EN| iView has always been the same.
10k/wav/9321.wav|EN-US|EN| But the Chemin product filled safety tests.
10k/wav/9329.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a green anthem on the group.
10k/wav/9340.wav|EN-US|EN| It made them as his beloved teacher.
10k/wav/9342.wav|EN-US|EN| Our position remains unchanged.
10k/wav/9351.wav|EN-US|EN| His strike was the pup.
10k/wav/9355.wav|EN-US|EN| Manchester Linnetep was still trying up to yesterday
10k/wav/9383.wav|EN-US|EN| It wouldn't happen every night, but things will get better.
10k/wav/9388.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been told by the doctor to rest.
10k/wav/939.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the way we go about it.
10k/wav/9396.wav|EN-US|EN| We all make mistakes.
10k/wav/940.wav|EN-US|EN| Within six minutes there were two goals down.
10k/wav/9404.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not just the agencies.
10k/wav/9407.wav|EN-US|EN| Five members were disciplined.
10k/wav/9411.wav|EN-US|EN| That reflected a tumble in banking shells across the port.
10k/wav/9413.wav|EN-US|EN| It is so very obvious.
10k/wav/9417.wav|EN-US|EN| So to Oryxin, as yet unbeaten on these travels with England
10k/wav/9438.wav|EN-US|EN| But there was no going back.
10k/wav/9445.wav|EN-US|EN| Two options are being proposed.
10k/wav/9464.wav|EN-US|EN| The site was launched in Durkal, Mandi.
10k/wav/9466.wav|EN-US|EN| It has raised the privilege of Scottish banking.
10k/wav/9472.wav|EN-US|EN| The time of judgment has arrived.
10k/wav/9473.wav|EN-US|EN| The cost of war is more than that.
10k/wav/9503.wav|EN-US|EN| It is deeply worrying.
10k/wav/9506.wav|EN-US|EN| We will miss him very much.
10k/wav/9511.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not too surprised.
10k/wav/9512.wav|EN-US|EN| He also has property interests in the country.
10k/wav/9513.wav|EN-US|EN| There's something about being cut off.
10k/wav/9529.wav|EN-US|EN| The money is within the total wallocation.
10k/wav/9531.wav|EN-US|EN| I have little time for analysts.
10k/wav/9544.wav|EN-US|EN| If I was a woman.
10k/wav/9557.wav|EN-US|EN| Colvin was back at his best today.
10k/wav/9592.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been active in Obia.
10k/wav/9604.wav|EN-US|EN| He will appear in court today.
10k/wav/9622.wav|EN-US|EN| Chinese has rarely sold in boxing toms.
10k/wav/9627.wav|EN-US|EN| The meat is good.
10k/wav/9635.wav|EN-US|EN| It will carry on.
10k/wav/9636.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been very grateful.
10k/wav/9656.wav|EN-US|EN| Why cool, he's running.
10k/wav/9658.wav|EN-US|EN| Her daughter is getting married.
10k/wav/9663.wav|EN-US|EN| It was some time before she found out he was safe.
10k/wav/9689.wav|EN-US|EN| Debbie Harry was cool.
10k/wav/969.wav|EN-US|EN| I just saw them for a few minutes.
10k/wav/9699.wav|EN-US|EN| The company yesterday refused to comment.
10k/wav/9705.wav|EN-US|EN| Together they will attempt to express the hell.
10k/wav/972.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't entirely buy that.
10k/wav/973.wav|EN-US|EN| We thought we would never see them again.
10k/wav/9739.wav|EN-US|EN| They knew they shouldn't have been there.
10k/wav/974.wav|EN-US|EN| Not so. It transpires.
10k/wav/9751.wav|EN-US|EN| We were right to be afraid.
10k/wav/9754.wav|EN-US|EN| with her candy lurking at the level of support.
10k/wav/9777.wav|EN-US|EN| Southeast is well down that route
10k/wav/979.wav|EN-US|EN| I kept going for her.
10k/wav/9790.wav|EN-US|EN| The pain was almost too much to bear.
10k/wav/9798.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's an enjoyable job.
10k/wav/98.wav|EN-US|EN| That will just be the beginning.
10k/wav/9801.wav|EN-US|EN| The course is in great condition.
10k/wav/9808.wav|EN-US|EN| It was cynical and callous.
10k/wav/9815.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone in front of me was dead.
10k/wav/9819.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no secrecy.
10k/wav/9825.wav|EN-US|EN| Friends of the Scotland last night, welcome to the announcement.
10k/wav/9830.wav|EN-US|EN| with our very interested in opening up in Germany.
10k/wav/9831.wav|EN-US|EN| The fire was falling from the sky.
10k/wav/9832.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been very carefully looked at.
10k/wav/9836.wav|EN-US|EN| This rule is our cake.
10k/wav/984.wav|EN-US|EN| I just went for it over the weekend.
10k/wav/985.wav|EN-US|EN| It is unique.
10k/wav/9850.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the waiters.
10k/wav/9852.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a policy they were against.
10k/wav/9861.wav|EN-US|EN| Our system is our cake
10k/wav/9872.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a good effort.
10k/wav/9875.wav|EN-US|EN| Our plans for Dunferman have not changed.
10k/wav/9900.wav|EN-US|EN| but we will just keep trying to get results.
10k/wav/991.wav|EN-US|EN| I know the way over a rock.
10k/wav/9927.wav|EN-US|EN| There is too much at stake for that.
10k/wav/9948.wav|EN-US|EN| They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
10k/wav/995.wav|EN-US|EN| If you believe in the blue and white.
10k/wav/9953.wav|EN-US|EN| It is easy to agree with him.
10k/wav/9954.wav|EN-US|EN| Another high street retailer was not so lucky.
10k/wav/9955.wav|EN-US|EN| It was good for us that they lost that day.
10k/wav/9962.wav|EN-US|EN| He knew it would cost him millions.
10k/wav/9969.wav|EN-US|EN| The initial report has been completed.
10k/wav/999.wav|EN-US|EN| She's Spin Shot.
10k/wav/1003.wav|EN-US|EN| Footage has been passed on to the police
10k/wav/1018.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that it?
10k/wav/1023.wav|EN-US|EN| This is perfectly legal.
10k/wav/1033.wav|EN-US|EN| He wouldn't do it.
10k/wav/1037.wav|EN-US|EN| He had no enemies.
10k/wav/1056.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a matter of clarity.
10k/wav/106.wav|EN-US|EN| I smell as fat as I can get.
10k/wav/1064.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm glad that justice has been done.
10k/wav/1067.wav|EN-US|EN| We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
10k/wav/1099.wav|EN-US|EN| Neil knows the score.
10k/wav/111.wav|EN-US|EN| The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
10k/wav/1115.wav|EN-US|EN| Police were also perplexed.
10k/wav/1117.wav|EN-US|EN| The Scots are however in good company.
10k/wav/1120.wav|EN-US|EN| No, it is actually in a book of flats.
10k/wav/1125.wav|EN-US|EN| They also have good neighbours.
10k/wav/1134.wav|EN-US|EN| For a few years we had good fun.
10k/wav/1141.wav|EN-US|EN| It is part of the endgame.
10k/wav/1144.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a difficult one to play.
10k/wav/1165.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was a great decision, Egypt.
10k/wav/1184.wav|EN-US|EN| It's got to come from me.
10k/wav/1199.wav|EN-US|EN| They were just too good for us.
10k/wav/1207.wav|EN-US|EN| Smoking is also very important.
10k/wav/1218.wav|EN-US|EN| I heard some of his remarks.
10k/wav/1224.wav|EN-US|EN| We all know it could not be true.
10k/wav/1227.wav|EN-US|EN| It was far more important than that.
10k/wav/1250.wav|EN-US|EN| It has until Saturday.
10k/wav/1264.wav|EN-US|EN| Sean Lee Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
10k/wav/1268.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't feel under any pressure.
10k/wav/1270.wav|EN-US|EN| All the time, that number was coming down under town.
10k/wav/1280.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all game cut.
10k/wav/1282.wav|EN-US|EN| A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
10k/wav/1289.wav|EN-US|EN| He looked like a scuba.
10k/wav/129.wav|EN-US|EN| No, no, it's not us you think.
10k/wav/1290.wav|EN-US|EN| It had until tomorrow to comply.
10k/wav/1301.wav|EN-US|EN| I was shot at but refused to back down
10k/wav/1304.wav|EN-US|EN| It may be at his last for a while, too.
10k/wav/1325.wav|EN-US|EN| Even then, he was in the media spotlight.
10k/wav/133.wav|EN-US|EN| I intend to raise the matter there
10k/wav/1330.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a rote bastard.
10k/wav/134.wav|EN-US|EN| But experience is a wonderful thing.
10k/wav/1382.wav|EN-US|EN| The questions came quick and fast.
10k/wav/1388.wav|EN-US|EN| There could be no dispute about Thar Hesti.
10k/wav/1393.wav|EN-US|EN| It was nice to finish in style.
10k/wav/1399.wav|EN-US|EN| But there is a possible place.
10k/wav/1438.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
10k/wav/1444.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a training class.
10k/wav/1447.wav|EN-US|EN| I would like to continue to develop.
10k/wav/1448.wav|EN-US|EN| We are doing okay in the leak.
10k/wav/1464.wav|EN-US|EN| My whole life has changed.
10k/wav/1473.wav|EN-US|EN| To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
10k/wav/1475.wav|EN-US|EN| People love to see this stuff.
10k/wav/149.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't understand it.
10k/wav/1500.wav|EN-US|EN| Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
10k/wav/1501.wav|EN-US|EN| I will let you in on a secret.
10k/wav/1505.wav|EN-US|EN| That tells you something.
10k/wav/1521.wav|EN-US|EN| She said they would appeal.
10k/wav/1537.wav|EN-US|EN| You just note
10k/wav/155.wav|EN-US|EN| alcohol and nicotine are now known Gary's
10k/wav/1551.wav|EN-US|EN| His contract was then not renewed.
10k/wav/1567.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two problems.
10k/wav/1574.wav|EN-US|EN| This will be no easy option.
10k/wav/1584.wav|EN-US|EN| But one was not enough.
10k/wav/1596.wav|EN-US|EN| The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
10k/wav/1601.wav|EN-US|EN| If they liked it then I will be happy.
10k/wav/1604.wav|EN-US|EN| Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
10k/wav/1611.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd be not filter about it.
10k/wav/1621.wav|EN-US|EN| He has become a monster.
10k/wav/1631.wav|EN-US|EN| It is up to us to approve it.
10k/wav/1643.wav|EN-US|EN| The family kept away from me.
10k/wav/1654.wav|EN-US|EN| I will never forget that.
10k/wav/1658.wav|EN-US|EN| It may have been a cry for help.
10k/wav/1665.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be decided in the next month.
10k/wav/1667.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither has gone to war.
10k/wav/1670.wav|EN-US|EN| He would not impose a phone.
10k/wav/1680.wav|EN-US|EN| Her mother said she didn't look very well at all.
10k/wav/1693.wav|EN-US|EN| He or she will ever see the leadership contest.
10k/wav/1721.wav|EN-US|EN| But the foreign secretary can cope.
10k/wav/175.wav|EN-US|EN| The police have an awful lot to explain.
10k/wav/1750.wav|EN-US|EN| The feedback from them has been fantastic.
10k/wav/1752.wav|EN-US|EN| I think that he got the message.
10k/wav/177.wav|EN-US|EN| I was a silly bastard.
10k/wav/1777.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to be massive.
10k/wav/1794.wav|EN-US|EN| They are expected to be released today.
10k/wav/1808.wav|EN-US|EN| Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
10k/wav/182.wav|EN-US|EN| For the meantime, though, the science are good.
10k/wav/1829.wav|EN-US|EN| Noble by the brunt of the cuts.
10k/wav/1843.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a very positive step format.
10k/wav/1854.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe in debate and dialogue.
10k/wav/1871.wav|EN-US|EN| He looked very sharp.
10k/wav/1899.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
10k/wav/1900.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
10k/wav/1901.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, what do you know?
10k/wav/1907.wav|EN-US|EN| We can all make a mistake.
10k/wav/1908.wav|EN-US|EN| I am delighted at my disappointment.
10k/wav/1914.wav|EN-US|EN| Why is he not fighting for the women?
10k/wav/1919.wav|EN-US|EN| It is becoming a bit of a habit.
10k/wav/1958.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time to find a decisive battle.
10k/wav/196.wav|EN-US|EN| But do you kiss?
10k/wav/198.wav|EN-US|EN| The game today is certainly different.
10k/wav/1984.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems a little short to me.
10k/wav/1986.wav|EN-US|EN| Our position is quite clear.
10k/wav/1990.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a job for the government.
10k/wav/1992.wav|EN-US|EN| Its feature is no ongoing question.
10k/wav/2.wav|EN-US|EN| She reflects a bit.
10k/wav/2016.wav|EN-US|EN| Charles Kennedy had an effect to Vatten.
10k/wav/2019.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was not just the land.
10k/wav/2040.wav|EN-US|EN| That was around July of August.
10k/wav/2042.wav|EN-US|EN| I just don't know why he is.
10k/wav/2044.wav|EN-US|EN| He seems to have everything.
10k/wav/2065.wav|EN-US|EN| The woman is a star with us going to love the lone light.
10k/wav/207.wav|EN-US|EN| There is nothing they can get on me.
10k/wav/2071.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not really commenting on that.
10k/wav/2077.wav|EN-US|EN| Also, we have lot lessened.
10k/wav/2137.wav|EN-US|EN| He worked there for six months.
10k/wav/2140.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't put my finger on it.
10k/wav/2152.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd happened until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
10k/wav/2153.wav|EN-US|EN| He must get to know himself.
10k/wav/2154.wav|EN-US|EN| I think he is the favourite.
10k/wav/2156.wav|EN-US|EN| A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
10k/wav/2165.wav|EN-US|EN| It is so easy to be negative.
10k/wav/2171.wav|EN-US|EN| The existing structure is in trouble.
10k/wav/2190.wav|EN-US|EN| What will happen if it all goes wrong?
10k/wav/2192.wav|EN-US|EN| United are in control without always being dominant
10k/wav/2206.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a road of death.
10k/wav/222.wav|EN-US|EN| I wouldn't too late that to happen.
10k/wav/2223.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to see the work.
10k/wav/2233.wav|EN-US|EN| You might not make it.
10k/wav/2244.wav|EN-US|EN| We will all suffer as a result.
10k/wav/2267.wav|EN-US|EN| He was taken ill in December last year.
10k/wav/2309.wav|EN-US|EN| Reaction to the device was mixed.
10k/wav/2310.wav|EN-US|EN| Finding the answer is a huge enjoyable experience.
10k/wav/232.wav|EN-US|EN| Lester was like that.
10k/wav/2354.wav|EN-US|EN| I had a choice and didn't really have to do that.
10k/wav/2356.wav|EN-US|EN| There could be a lot of confusion.
10k/wav/2365.wav|EN-US|EN| Quality was high in all sections.
10k/wav/2397.wav|EN-US|EN| You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
10k/wav/24.wav|EN-US|EN| It is to be less than five minutes.
10k/wav/2400.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to go down with how to struggle.
10k/wav/2412.wav|EN-US|EN| He must have a crack at it.
10k/wav/2422.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm so, so, so lucky
10k/wav/2438.wav|EN-US|EN| It may be done, but Newlork is not out.
10k/wav/2441.wav|EN-US|EN| Saddam is not threatening this country.
10k/wav/2443.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no serious injuries.
10k/wav/2446.wav|EN-US|EN| I've bet he's at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow tonight.
10k/wav/246.wav|EN-US|EN| That is still in place.
10k/wav/2469.wav|EN-US|EN| The condition last night was described as critical.
10k/wav/2474.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a bit overwhelmed.
10k/wav/249.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not big brother, let's see.
10k/wav/2506.wav|EN-US|EN| We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
10k/wav/2520.wav|EN-US|EN| Bottling is now the core business.
10k/wav/2527.wav|EN-US|EN| But we never wanted to do that.
10k/wav/2535.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a job for the government.
10k/wav/2538.wav|EN-US|EN| I had a fortune at war.
10k/wav/2542.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got a job to do.
10k/wav/2546.wav|EN-US|EN| Built for more grain.
10k/wav/2551.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, they are the future of investment.
10k/wav/2552.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it is totally wrong.
10k/wav/2556.wav|EN-US|EN| Or maybe it's the other way around.
10k/wav/2561.wav|EN-US|EN| and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
10k/wav/2566.wav|EN-US|EN| Whilst they desupped.
10k/wav/2582.wav|EN-US|EN| Ellaria was clearly disgusted.
10k/wav/2594.wav|EN-US|EN| He saw terrible offenses.
10k/wav/2599.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very, very frightening
10k/wav/260.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody can change it overnight but you can make a start.
10k/wav/2601.wav|EN-US|EN| It's greatness, isn't it?
10k/wav/2604.wav|EN-US|EN| Such a policy is for long term strength.
10k/wav/2612.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland were on Saturday.
10k/wav/2616.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that what it's about?
10k/wav/2618.wav|EN-US|EN| Only one was from Glasgow.
10k/wav/2620.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought to myself.
10k/wav/2621.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a club on the rise.
10k/wav/2625.wav|EN-US|EN| I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
10k/wav/2630.wav|EN-US|EN| But there was a shift.
10k/wav/2631.wav|EN-US|EN| He now describes himself as Scottish Labor.
10k/wav/2644.wav|EN-US|EN| The circumstances have changed since last year.
10k/wav/2648.wav|EN-US|EN| I was in tears in the street.
10k/wav/2655.wav|EN-US|EN| I will take the plane for that
10k/wav/2659.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a massive result for us.
10k/wav/2663.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got to attack.
10k/wav/2664.wav|EN-US|EN| I will not be in dialogue with her.
10k/wav/2675.wav|EN-US|EN| Sherman Salister Grant will remain on the board as Deputy Chairman.
10k/wav/268.wav|EN-US|EN| One paper was not returned.
10k/wav/2709.wav|EN-US|EN| Induct inflation data will be published this moment.
10k/wav/2719.wav|EN-US|EN| I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
10k/wav/2741.wav|EN-US|EN| You just have to accept.
10k/wav/2751.wav|EN-US|EN| However, this weekend it will be different.
10k/wav/2780.wav|EN-US|EN| It is physical but it is also good.
10k/wav/2784.wav|EN-US|EN| The right decision has been made.
10k/wav/2798.wav|EN-US|EN| Walker plans to return indoors.
10k/wav/2806.wav|EN-US|EN| They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
10k/wav/2818.wav|EN-US|EN| I decided it is going to be William.
10k/wav/283.wav|EN-US|EN| She opens tonight in Glasgow at the King's Theatre.
10k/wav/2837.wav|EN-US|EN| Left was like a timetable.
10k/wav/2850.wav|EN-US|EN| The ethos of the skill was outstanding.
10k/wav/2855.wav|EN-US|EN| He would have come into the house.
10k/wav/2864.wav|EN-US|EN| For me, it was a shattering experience.
10k/wav/2867.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be no disruption to teaching.
10k/wav/2875.wav|EN-US|EN| I love the feel of the place.
10k/wav/2879.wav|EN-US|EN| Wampum Wildems is Subtit.
10k/wav/2880.wav|EN-US|EN| She may even appear in some more films
10k/wav/2884.wav|EN-US|EN| The Allies intend to maintain the average
10k/wav/2888.wav|EN-US|EN| That can benefit the larger companies.
10k/wav/2891.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never been overly ambitious.
10k/wav/2896.wav|EN-US|EN| We are hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
10k/wav/2899.wav|EN-US|EN| On that degree.
10k/wav/2911.wav|EN-US|EN| He was not entirely correct.
10k/wav/2917.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very relieved.
10k/wav/2927.wav|EN-US|EN| Our action is not the end but the beginning of a process.
10k/wav/293.wav|EN-US|EN| Do they think anyone else wants them?
10k/wav/2934.wav|EN-US|EN| Their conclusions were never published.
10k/wav/2966.wav|EN-US|EN| They were all on the mission.
10k/wav/2973.wav|EN-US|EN| I had decided to quit the show.
10k/wav/2976.wav|EN-US|EN| The squad is too small.
10k/wav/2979.wav|EN-US|EN| This ruling is a false.
10k/wav/30.wav|EN-US|EN| After that though, we are still waiting to see.
10k/wav/3002.wav|EN-US|EN| Things are going to change over the next six months.
10k/wav/3003.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
10k/wav/3004.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no question of tethering.
10k/wav/3017.wav|EN-US|EN| We are obviously disturbed by this case.
10k/wav/3028.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the rugby rightest in London.
10k/wav/3035.wav|EN-US|EN| But there is also love for the souls.
10k/wav/305.wav|EN-US|EN| I realised I was lucky to have it.
10k/wav/3056.wav|EN-US|EN| They're already on the way though
10k/wav/3082.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
10k/wav/3099.wav|EN-US|EN| All inquiries should be made to the police.
10k/wav/3104.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
10k/wav/3107.wav|EN-US|EN| I joined a group.
10k/wav/3121.wav|EN-US|EN| But I hope the referee cannot go back on his decision.
10k/wav/3126.wav|EN-US|EN| I was very influenced by him.
10k/wav/3134.wav|EN-US|EN| And Kashaw police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
10k/wav/3142.wav|EN-US|EN| They are a very good side, without a doubt.
10k/wav/3147.wav|EN-US|EN| A bit of match fitness is required.
10k/wav/3175.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, this is nice to her.
10k/wav/3177.wav|EN-US|EN| We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
10k/wav/3184.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, did that finish?
10k/wav/3209.wav|EN-US|EN| Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
10k/wav/3219.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't a pretty much.
10k/wav/3233.wav|EN-US|EN| We can certainly build on this.
10k/wav/3246.wav|EN-US|EN| You have caught a serial killer.
10k/wav/3247.wav|EN-US|EN| I've not said anything to them, they know.
10k/wav/325.wav|EN-US|EN| Gay pocket is a favourite of mine.
10k/wav/3251.wav|EN-US|EN| I always liked to get a laugh.
10k/wav/3260.wav|EN-US|EN| At this point we can only speculate.
10k/wav/3264.wav|EN-US|EN| This time mate was out of the blue.
10k/wav/3268.wav|EN-US|EN| They let you see the world through fresh provides.
10k/wav/327.wav|EN-US|EN| We are delighted with that.
10k/wav/3282.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got to get it right.
10k/wav/3291.wav|EN-US|EN| The office is a show about nothing, then.
10k/wav/3292.wav|EN-US|EN| These people just lost their child.
10k/wav/3298.wav|EN-US|EN| Malini is an engaging talent.
10k/wav/3316.wav|EN-US|EN| Such debate is pointless.
10k/wav/3330.wav|EN-US|EN| We have made no final decisions.
10k/wav/3348.wav|EN-US|EN| For sure, you wouldn't know unless you ask him.
10k/wav/335.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be strictly across the country.
10k/wav/3352.wav|EN-US|EN| They are real.
10k/wav/3373.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a song with a rella
10k/wav/3376.wav|EN-US|EN| None of the pieces was commissioned.
10k/wav/3379.wav|EN-US|EN| If it's going in, it goes in
10k/wav/3412.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
10k/wav/3413.wav|EN-US|EN| It is like being the qualifier again.
10k/wav/3418.wav|EN-US|EN| Things are moving together.
10k/wav/3431.wav|EN-US|EN| An announcement is expected within a few months.
10k/wav/3432.wav|EN-US|EN| At half the time we have
10k/wav/3464.wav|EN-US|EN| The painting was started but finishing it was quite another matter.
10k/wav/3466.wav|EN-US|EN| Much the same thing happens in a land company.
10k/wav/3471.wav|EN-US|EN| We can't go home.
10k/wav/3483.wav|EN-US|EN| I just had so much fun
10k/wav/3489.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, it might just be beginning
10k/wav/3499.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone deserves to share in this success.
10k/wav/3508.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, they go hand in hand
10k/wav/3523.wav|EN-US|EN| The group is currently working to create several substantial new funds.
10k/wav/3527.wav|EN-US|EN| We really need research to help with that.
10k/wav/3529.wav|EN-US|EN| Naturally enough, the letter in question was any.
10k/wav/3541.wav|EN-US|EN| I found that we couldn't.
10k/wav/3542.wav|EN-US|EN| It will take several days.
10k/wav/3573.wav|EN-US|EN| We will continue to pressure the government.
10k/wav/3576.wav|EN-US|EN| however the drama was still not at an end
10k/wav/3583.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a lot of writing.
10k/wav/3593.wav|EN-US|EN| Is there anything in the want?
10k/wav/3595.wav|EN-US|EN| Two Israeli accompaniments were in the building at the time.
10k/wav/3598.wav|EN-US|EN| We should have no more problems.
10k/wav/3604.wav|EN-US|EN| This time it really could happen.
10k/wav/361.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm proud of moments like that.
10k/wav/3628.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
10k/wav/3635.wav|EN-US|EN| He has earned the right to thy respect.
10k/wav/3654.wav|EN-US|EN| And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
10k/wav/3661.wav|EN-US|EN| Seljumis Hussain is the devil.
10k/wav/3687.wav|EN-US|EN| That must have had any effect.
10k/wav/3697.wav|EN-US|EN| He was felt by his health authority.
10k/wav/3703.wav|EN-US|EN| They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
10k/wav/3713.wav|EN-US|EN| We are aiming for every march.
10k/wav/3744.wav|EN-US|EN| I became a widow overnight.
10k/wav/3748.wav|EN-US|EN| What went wrong?
10k/wav/375.wav|EN-US|EN| I am feeling pretty good.
10k/wav/376.wav|EN-US|EN| It does seem a mystery.
10k/wav/3769.wav|EN-US|EN| The cup is narrowing.
10k/wav/3775.wav|EN-US|EN| And they were being paid?
10k/wav/378.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to deal with this stuff.
10k/wav/3784.wav|EN-US|EN| It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
10k/wav/3800.wav|EN-US|EN| He has to learn.
10k/wav/3822.wav|EN-US|EN| It will take time.
10k/wav/3823.wav|EN-US|EN| That incident tortured the pattern of the game.
10k/wav/3836.wav|EN-US|EN| We must do that.
10k/wav/3844.wav|EN-US|EN| There are a huge number of vaults.
10k/wav/3846.wav|EN-US|EN| The attacker has been put in foster care.
10k/wav/3857.wav|EN-US|EN| That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
10k/wav/3861.wav|EN-US|EN| Do I think about them often?
10k/wav/3863.wav|EN-US|EN| Usually, you should leave it to learn in the box.
10k/wav/3874.wav|EN-US|EN| Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
10k/wav/3891.wav|EN-US|EN| He will do you very well.
10k/wav/3896.wav|EN-US|EN| The Tory party will last.
10k/wav/3897.wav|EN-US|EN| But they didn't much like that.
10k/wav/3911.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still getting over it.
10k/wav/392.wav|EN-US|EN| They have three children.
10k/wav/3923.wav|EN-US|EN| And then came the 70s.
10k/wav/3949.wav|EN-US|EN| You've got to fight to stop.
10k/wav/3954.wav|EN-US|EN| The people are the hero.
10k/wav/3958.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe they are dead.
10k/wav/3965.wav|EN-US|EN| He remains the main board director of rule.
10k/wav/3967.wav|EN-US|EN| Why does it come at me?
10k/wav/399.wav|EN-US|EN| She is now planning a visit.
10k/wav/4019.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
10k/wav/402.wav|EN-US|EN| Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
10k/wav/4020.wav|EN-US|EN| The insider opens tomorrow.
10k/wav/4041.wav|EN-US|EN| The response was really good.
10k/wav/4045.wav|EN-US|EN| None of the opinions is good.
10k/wav/4048.wav|EN-US|EN| Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
10k/wav/4057.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted really to deal with two opposite energies.
10k/wav/4058.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a central issue.
10k/wav/4059.wav|EN-US|EN| They're already there.
10k/wav/4070.wav|EN-US|EN| which is where the manager comes in.
10k/wav/41.wav|EN-US|EN| I will never manage another Scottish club.
10k/wav/411.wav|EN-US|EN| There is nothing to fear.
10k/wav/4151.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't want to change anything.
10k/wav/4154.wav|EN-US|EN| She was close to suicide at one stage.
10k/wav/4159.wav|EN-US|EN| Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
10k/wav/4174.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem was a social problem.
10k/wav/4180.wav|EN-US|EN| When she went off it was quite amazing.
10k/wav/4186.wav|EN-US|EN| But we will not be scared.
10k/wav/4195.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone can have their opinion.
10k/wav/4201.wav|EN-US|EN| The shells are a stronghold.
10k/wav/4206.wav|EN-US|EN| The time was right.
10k/wav/4216.wav|EN-US|EN| This isn't a portrayal of public services. It's the renewal.
10k/wav/4245.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night the bombardment was terrible.
10k/wav/4248.wav|EN-US|EN| Now we see no mention of rising rates.
10k/wav/425.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a historic agreement.
10k/wav/4264.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been deeply sorry they did.
10k/wav/4274.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
10k/wav/4288.wav|EN-US|EN| We could do a lot worse.
10k/wav/4295.wav|EN-US|EN| Fairly to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
10k/wav/431.wav|EN-US|EN| But we have built a platform for next season.
10k/wav/4312.wav|EN-US|EN| He is under no allegiance.
10k/wav/4324.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it was just a tragic accident.
10k/wav/4348.wav|EN-US|EN| We played them off the pitch.
10k/wav/4349.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing was going to go right.
10k/wav/4352.wav|EN-US|EN| The players were under pressure.
10k/wav/4359.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a good thing.
10k/wav/436.wav|EN-US|EN| He was taken ill in his office.
10k/wav/4361.wav|EN-US|EN| It's nice.
10k/wav/4380.wav|EN-US|EN| The hell point is to get the issue into the open.
10k/wav/4391.wav|EN-US|EN| Craig is still suffering seizures.
10k/wav/4399.wav|EN-US|EN| I get to work with very good people.
10k/wav/4411.wav|EN-US|EN| Ten Iblo should get out more
10k/wav/4412.wav|EN-US|EN| They are looking for profit.
10k/wav/4415.wav|EN-US|EN| It is for policy ministers to defend their policies.
10k/wav/4442.wav|EN-US|EN| Chen Praskot, a deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
10k/wav/4443.wav|EN-US|EN| He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
10k/wav/4454.wav|EN-US|EN| People have been placed in a state of alarm.
10k/wav/4457.wav|EN-US|EN| They just would not have run away.
10k/wav/4473.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody even it had happened.
10k/wav/448.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a new concept in jazz.
10k/wav/4487.wav|EN-US|EN| Please call Stella.
10k/wav/4493.wav|EN-US|EN| We suffered a lot for seven years.
10k/wav/4497.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel strongly about it.
10k/wav/4507.wav|EN-US|EN| They said to me why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
10k/wav/4509.wav|EN-US|EN| Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
10k/wav/4517.wav|EN-US|EN| The warnings were good reminder.
10k/wav/4531.wav|EN-US|EN| Ray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
10k/wav/4540.wav|EN-US|EN| and they replied.
10k/wav/4544.wav|EN-US|EN| Both these events occur on Wednesday night.
10k/wav/4549.wav|EN-US|EN| She is a valuable member of the government.
10k/wav/4552.wav|EN-US|EN| I was over the moon.
10k/wav/4566.wav|EN-US|EN| Mission described it as a unique event.
10k/wav/4587.wav|EN-US|EN| There will have to be a full inquiry.
10k/wav/4605.wav|EN-US|EN| The auction will be held tomorrow.
10k/wav/4611.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very hard to plan for it.
10k/wav/4613.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very sensitive.
10k/wav/4628.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not great art.
10k/wav/4629.wav|EN-US|EN| Why immune system have been depleted?
10k/wav/4638.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not out of touch with politics.
10k/wav/4640.wav|EN-US|EN| Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
10k/wav/4653.wav|EN-US|EN| The course has helped a lot.
10k/wav/4666.wav|EN-US|EN| I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes
10k/wav/47.wav|EN-US|EN| We are determined to establish the facts.
10k/wav/4731.wav|EN-US|EN| We are a peaceful people.
10k/wav/4734.wav|EN-US|EN| That fixture will always remain with me.
10k/wav/474.wav|EN-US|EN| This is already happening.
10k/wav/4742.wav|EN-US|EN| They made such decisions in London.
10k/wav/4772.wav|EN-US|EN| We are committed to the ban.
10k/wav/4782.wav|EN-US|EN| So people will come up with these things.
10k/wav/4789.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a substantial value of our sets on the ground.
10k/wav/4804.wav|EN-US|EN| We feel it sends out the wrong message.
10k/wav/4820.wav|EN-US|EN| And that was the adults.
10k/wav/4826.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a fantastic achievement.
10k/wav/4835.wav|EN-US|EN| The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
10k/wav/4839.wav|EN-US|EN| How do you resect a dying town?
10k/wav/4843.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to go for a win.
10k/wav/4847.wav|EN-US|EN| This has been blown out of all proportion.
10k/wav/4861.wav|EN-US|EN| They hit me in the hut.
10k/wav/4869.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the northeast.
10k/wav/487.wav|EN-US|EN| We welcome the Minister's decision.
10k/wav/4875.wav|EN-US|EN| But it could be a consequence of our policy.
10k/wav/4879.wav|EN-US|EN| This is totally untrue
10k/wav/4883.wav|EN-US|EN| The latter were not from Scotland.
10k/wav/4900.wav|EN-US|EN| The results are very positive.
10k/wav/4908.wav|EN-US|EN| At the end of the day, two men have been shot
10k/wav/4924.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very young and very keen to do well.
10k/wav/4931.wav|EN-US|EN| To sit now.
10k/wav/4932.wav|EN-US|EN| His second goal was equally impressive.
10k/wav/4936.wav|EN-US|EN| There is the beautiful game to write.
10k/wav/4937.wav|EN-US|EN| I always loved the lightning in the movies.
10k/wav/4967.wav|EN-US|EN| I had no idea.
10k/wav/4975.wav|EN-US|EN| You went easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
10k/wav/4977.wav|EN-US|EN| It was early morning.
10k/wav/4987.wav|EN-US|EN| The bookies have got it about right.
10k/wav/4989.wav|EN-US|EN| So the options had to be explored.
10k/wav/5.wav|EN-US|EN| This is really good news for us.
10k/wav/50.wav|EN-US|EN| Edie Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
10k/wav/5003.wav|EN-US|EN| As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
10k/wav/5006.wav|EN-US|EN| Some days came against Celtic as each.
10k/wav/5018.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the September weekend after all.
10k/wav/5052.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a good performance.
10k/wav/5054.wav|EN-US|EN| They showed a lot of heart.
10k/wav/5057.wav|EN-US|EN| It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
10k/wav/5062.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't make out what was going on.
10k/wav/5065.wav|EN-US|EN| They were later discharged from hospital.
10k/wav/5073.wav|EN-US|EN| He was a shooting star.
10k/wav/5083.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
10k/wav/5088.wav|EN-US|EN| I have heard stories from Scotland.
10k/wav/509.wav|EN-US|EN| I see it as my job.
10k/wav/5096.wav|EN-US|EN| It was published yesterday on the internet
10k/wav/5099.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been preparing Nolio.
10k/wav/5114.wav|EN-US|EN| He will consult the right people.
10k/wav/5116.wav|EN-US|EN| I would say happy that she did.
10k/wav/5133.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything has collapsed.
10k/wav/5134.wav|EN-US|EN| and a film Makeup was born.
10k/wav/517.wav|EN-US|EN| Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by a reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
10k/wav/5180.wav|EN-US|EN| She was totally possessed.
10k/wav/5181.wav|EN-US|EN| He was unable to come.
10k/wav/5188.wav|EN-US|EN| Johnson is equally concerned.
10k/wav/5193.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd love to do another Olympics.
10k/wav/5195.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, you can't have everything.
10k/wav/5197.wav|EN-US|EN| The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
10k/wav/520.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope we've reached the bottom there.
10k/wav/5216.wav|EN-US|EN| The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
10k/wav/5221.wav|EN-US|EN| That is an entirely unacceptable position.
10k/wav/5238.wav|EN-US|EN| It represents a complete change in emphasis.
10k/wav/524.wav|EN-US|EN| The decision was claimed on weak investment markets.
10k/wav/5252.wav|EN-US|EN| That doesn't mean the cabinet has to endorse.
10k/wav/5253.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been a long wait.
10k/wav/5258.wav|EN-US|EN| This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
10k/wav/5260.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no evidence for that.
10k/wav/5271.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't always work that way.
10k/wav/5281.wav|EN-US|EN| It was no more than they deserved.
10k/wav/5285.wav|EN-US|EN| I have wanted to buy one for the national curry.
10k/wav/5294.wav|EN-US|EN| This morning I got a call from my wife.
10k/wav/5296.wav|EN-US|EN| See it while you can.
10k/wav/5302.wav|EN-US|EN| But let's not go down that road.
10k/wav/531.wav|EN-US|EN| This could prove a problem.
10k/wav/5310.wav|EN-US|EN| It may be the first of many.
10k/wav/5312.wav|EN-US|EN| I've had so great filler for that.
10k/wav/5313.wav|EN-US|EN| That was our mission.
10k/wav/5321.wav|EN-US|EN| But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
10k/wav/5330.wav|EN-US|EN| What was going through her mind that day, that night?
10k/wav/534.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he said the proposal was at an early stage
10k/wav/5341.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just going to go for it.
10k/wav/535.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody could survive on that.
10k/wav/5365.wav|EN-US|EN| courses have some sense.
10k/wav/5368.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he was later released without charge.
10k/wav/537.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm glad that he's angry.
10k/wav/5383.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly it can go either way.
10k/wav/5387.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm in a good position.
10k/wav/5393.wav|EN-US|EN| It is bizarre.
10k/wav/5412.wav|EN-US|EN| That just wasn't good enough.
10k/wav/5422.wav|EN-US|EN| The salary changes are long overdue.
10k/wav/5450.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you think there would be any better?
10k/wav/5455.wav|EN-US|EN| It just sounds like we were yesterday.
10k/wav/5463.wav|EN-US|EN| Our position is not a logic of war.
10k/wav/5466.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm appalled by this news.
10k/wav/5470.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no sign that anything was amiss.
10k/wav/5471.wav|EN-US|EN| They are there to help us.
10k/wav/5488.wav|EN-US|EN| The research was my life.
10k/wav/5494.wav|EN-US|EN| The manager knew me very well.
10k/wav/5502.wav|EN-US|EN| My conscience is not clear.
10k/wav/5508.wav|EN-US|EN| Off to Tinas as we're calling it here.
10k/wav/5511.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone knew whatever.
10k/wav/5514.wav|EN-US|EN| The family moved down a lot.
10k/wav/5553.wav|EN-US|EN| It is like a theatre of the upset.
10k/wav/5558.wav|EN-US|EN| Public opinion was put on the proposal.
10k/wav/5560.wav|EN-US|EN| They make it look crazy.
10k/wav/5562.wav|EN-US|EN| Some people have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
10k/wav/5572.wav|EN-US|EN| But we welcome this document.
10k/wav/5574.wav|EN-US|EN| Make sure you see it
10k/wav/5585.wav|EN-US|EN| Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
10k/wav/5587.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not just my personal view.
10k/wav/5601.wav|EN-US|EN| The winner will be announced next month.
10k/wav/5620.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lot of fear.
10k/wav/5625.wav|EN-US|EN| We were still paying the price for that.
10k/wav/5627.wav|EN-US|EN| It is thy day.
10k/wav/5630.wav|EN-US|EN| In practice, the economic tests have to be met.
10k/wav/5639.wav|EN-US|EN| Shinge will however have to be a neuros
10k/wav/5644.wav|EN-US|EN| That was their attitude.
10k/wav/5653.wav|EN-US|EN| He said current trading was strong.
10k/wav/5655.wav|EN-US|EN| Obviously, we would want to look at this.
10k/wav/5661.wav|EN-US|EN| It was extremely cold.
10k/wav/5667.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought their commitment was supup.
10k/wav/5673.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday Mr Haik dismissed the pull.
10k/wav/5698.wav|EN-US|EN| They will notice a difference.
10k/wav/5699.wav|EN-US|EN| Nope is not a threat to Britain.
10k/wav/5723.wav|EN-US|EN| He's very explosive.
10k/wav/5758.wav|EN-US|EN| He was rejected because he had retired.
10k/wav/5763.wav|EN-US|EN| There have been a lot of lessons learned.
10k/wav/5772.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel it is very irrational.
10k/wav/5775.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe you may be that person.
10k/wav/5785.wav|EN-US|EN| That's hot for women.
10k/wav/5788.wav|EN-US|EN| Catch another.
10k/wav/5794.wav|EN-US|EN| They had a good start as well.
10k/wav/5807.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to pull together or we will hand the pot.
10k/wav/581.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a judgement tissue.
10k/wav/5819.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to get that sorted.
10k/wav/5827.wav|EN-US|EN| It is too early to say.
10k/wav/5837.wav|EN-US|EN| What was the matter for concern?
10k/wav/584.wav|EN-US|EN| What was the difference between them?
10k/wav/5840.wav|EN-US|EN| People have been wonderful beyond belief.
10k/wav/5846.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the strength of the school.
10k/wav/5849.wav|EN-US|EN| I was just doing my job.
10k/wav/5850.wav|EN-US|EN| It was always an option.
10k/wav/5854.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt under no pressure today.
10k/wav/5876.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a freedom.
10k/wav/5887.wav|EN-US|EN| We are aware of the problem.
10k/wav/5898.wav|EN-US|EN| She had been in Gemini for medical treatment.
10k/wav/590.wav|EN-US|EN| The shareholders will get to wind up the company on Friday morning.
10k/wav/5901.wav|EN-US|EN| Our season is not over.
10k/wav/5917.wav|EN-US|EN| And it worked, so we kept it.
10k/wav/592.wav|EN-US|EN| That is moral.
10k/wav/5943.wav|EN-US|EN| The company did not declarative stand.
10k/wav/5957.wav|EN-US|EN| Sell to call the lease is then
10k/wav/6008.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very relieved that I have finally won.
10k/wav/6009.wav|EN-US|EN| We see later a sign of improvement.
10k/wav/601.wav|EN-US|EN| He is in the queue.
10k/wav/6011.wav|EN-US|EN| And so they have.
10k/wav/6035.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm feeling on top of the boat
10k/wav/6036.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
10k/wav/6038.wav|EN-US|EN| You will be very very welcome.
10k/wav/6040.wav|EN-US|EN| So what's this install?
10k/wav/6041.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there you have it. Success has eluded them so far.
10k/wav/606.wav|EN-US|EN| She seemed as moved by her own words as helped the insular.
10k/wav/6069.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a little bit tired
10k/wav/608.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to learn lessons from these things.
10k/wav/6081.wav|EN-US|EN| We had planned to sell the property for some time.
10k/wav/611.wav|EN-US|EN| There is great potential on this river.
10k/wav/6123.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd be had a wonderful Claire.
10k/wav/6126.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the drama was not over
10k/wav/6132.wav|EN-US|EN| That was my last game.
10k/wav/6143.wav|EN-US|EN| The best thing for me was to join the army.
10k/wav/6149.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been totally taken aback by this.
10k/wav/6159.wav|EN-US|EN| I have just got to get back.
10k/wav/6186.wav|EN-US|EN| In the past few years they have started to fight back.
10k/wav/6212.wav|EN-US|EN| We avail in the state of shock.
10k/wav/6217.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the man who provides the hope.
10k/wav/6219.wav|EN-US|EN| I doubt it would be genuine.
10k/wav/6237.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a question of life and death.
10k/wav/6245.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not see anything to begin with.
10k/wav/6246.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
10k/wav/6251.wav|EN-US|EN| It is so beautiful.
10k/wav/6260.wav|EN-US|EN| They came into collision with Sajio.
10k/wav/6262.wav|EN-US|EN| This government is cutting taxes.
10k/wav/6283.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
10k/wav/6296.wav|EN-US|EN| But he was a really nice man.
10k/wav/6322.wav|EN-US|EN| He has to pull back from the brink.
10k/wav/6336.wav|EN-US|EN| All the names are familiar to me.
10k/wav/6338.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no other offer on the table.
10k/wav/6340.wav|EN-US|EN| Footballers have also been targeted.
10k/wav/6351.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought they were just excited.
10k/wav/6359.wav|EN-US|EN| For tragedy it is.
10k/wav/6378.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night the company could not be contacted.
10k/wav/640.wav|EN-US|EN| We do know the reaction of the sack.
10k/wav/6419.wav|EN-US|EN| Axis itself was created from that exercise.
10k/wav/6423.wav|EN-US|EN| In that case the children were not missing.
10k/wav/6452.wav|EN-US|EN| Shaveli history will not repeat itself.
10k/wav/6464.wav|EN-US|EN| It will always be the highlight of my career.
10k/wav/6466.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything else is the same.
10k/wav/6468.wav|EN-US|EN| Survival is armed
10k/wav/647.wav|EN-US|EN| We needed financial backing to get it off the crout.
10k/wav/6472.wav|EN-US|EN| We also enjoyed a lot of support.
10k/wav/6476.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just one of those days.
10k/wav/6477.wav|EN-US|EN| His appeal is instantly understood.
10k/wav/6492.wav|EN-US|EN| After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
10k/wav/6493.wav|EN-US|EN| A Grampian police spokesman said
10k/wav/6494.wav|EN-US|EN| Whatever happened to that one?
10k/wav/6515.wav|EN-US|EN| They could not ignore the will of Parliament, he claimed.
10k/wav/6536.wav|EN-US|EN| Those were the days, indeed.
10k/wav/6541.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it did not end that way
10k/wav/6547.wav|EN-US|EN| For us, that decision was hard to understand
10k/wav/6559.wav|EN-US|EN| Cordon Prime did not inherit a mess.
10k/wav/6576.wav|EN-US|EN| He's not perfect.
10k/wav/6579.wav|EN-US|EN| The damage has been done.
10k/wav/6584.wav|EN-US|EN| Knowledge is everything at this level.
10k/wav/6591.wav|EN-US|EN| Tommy is not a problem.
10k/wav/6613.wav|EN-US|EN| The police are not the target.
10k/wav/663.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a little girl.
10k/wav/6630.wav|EN-US|EN| It is probably in the culture.
10k/wav/6637.wav|EN-US|EN| Strathguide Peace has appealed for weaknesses.
10k/wav/6660.wav|EN-US|EN| Pray for Westminster is the Holy Grail.
10k/wav/6669.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything is in the mix.
10k/wav/6681.wav|EN-US|EN| The hydros man has finally developed to face.
10k/wav/6693.wav|EN-US|EN| It was finally agreed on Saturday.
10k/wav/6700.wav|EN-US|EN| We were used.
10k/wav/6702.wav|EN-US|EN| Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball came.
10k/wav/672.wav|EN-US|EN| A deadline is still essential.
10k/wav/6730.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a big game for them.
10k/wav/6738.wav|EN-US|EN| And finally, I have good news for the songboats of Glasgow.
10k/wav/674.wav|EN-US|EN| That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
10k/wav/6742.wav|EN-US|EN| I have found my vision.
10k/wav/6747.wav|EN-US|EN| The savalanche is just the beginning
10k/wav/6756.wav|EN-US|EN| Whatever we do, we know we can do well
10k/wav/6767.wav|EN-US|EN| It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
10k/wav/6769.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you want?
10k/wav/6784.wav|EN-US|EN| They must play for each other.
10k/wav/6788.wav|EN-US|EN| I had too much to drink.
10k/wav/6793.wav|EN-US|EN| The car driver was not injured.
10k/wav/680.wav|EN-US|EN| He intends to restart in this print.
10k/wav/6801.wav|EN-US|EN| And we were very lucky.
10k/wav/6809.wav|EN-US|EN| May not have been effort.
10k/wav/6814.wav|EN-US|EN| I was utterly happy I said it, it must be sandy.
10k/wav/6820.wav|EN-US|EN| These sorts will deliver improvements on the ground.
10k/wav/6828.wav|EN-US|EN| He said Mr. Holland was a disgrace.
10k/wav/6830.wav|EN-US|EN| There was an email.
10k/wav/6832.wav|EN-US|EN| There are just two tournaments remaining.
10k/wav/6843.wav|EN-US|EN| It is urgent.
10k/wav/6847.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
10k/wav/6854.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the big omission.
10k/wav/6855.wav|EN-US|EN| The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
10k/wav/6867.wav|EN-US|EN| We recorded it at iron expense.
10k/wav/6869.wav|EN-US|EN| She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
10k/wav/687.wav|EN-US|EN| What can you do?
10k/wav/6887.wav|EN-US|EN| However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
10k/wav/6888.wav|EN-US|EN| Who cares about that?
10k/wav/6894.wav|EN-US|EN| I was very lucky.
10k/wav/6918.wav|EN-US|EN| Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
10k/wav/6936.wav|EN-US|EN| But overall, Aberdeen looks well placed for growth.
10k/wav/6951.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not changed at all.
10k/wav/6965.wav|EN-US|EN| How do takers want their pupils to conform?
10k/wav/697.wav|EN-US|EN| Shim has not been a problem for me at all.
10k/wav/6970.wav|EN-US|EN| At that time, there was no infection within 5 miles.
10k/wav/6975.wav|EN-US|EN| Less, it gave me a lot of confidence.
10k/wav/6979.wav|EN-US|EN| The function of the clock is to provide advice.
10k/wav/698.wav|EN-US|EN| But the attachment took a lot of grain.
10k/wav/6980.wav|EN-US|EN| The winner will be announced in December.
10k/wav/6983.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no doubt about that.
10k/wav/699.wav|EN-US|EN| South Africa is the next likely customer.
10k/wav/6996.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the potty that counts.
10k/wav/700.wav|EN-US|EN| It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
10k/wav/7002.wav|EN-US|EN| The most important thing is the game.
10k/wav/7018.wav|EN-US|EN| The colours are very pretty.
10k/wav/7030.wav|EN-US|EN| He was their meter.
10k/wav/7031.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't a flight of fancy.
10k/wav/7033.wav|EN-US|EN| These people are helpless.
10k/wav/7037.wav|EN-US|EN| They've got a sort of a middle contract.
10k/wav/704.wav|EN-US|EN| Our destiny is in our own hands.
10k/wav/7059.wav|EN-US|EN| I told him to stop.
10k/wav/7060.wav|EN-US|EN| Still, in the end, it was a fair result
10k/wav/7064.wav|EN-US|EN| This is about the orange order.
10k/wav/7070.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been very frightened of the dark.
10k/wav/7075.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a form of physical exercise.
10k/wav/7079.wav|EN-US|EN| It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
10k/wav/7083.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a rush of water.
10k/wav/710.wav|EN-US|EN| But this tastes odd and con.
10k/wav/7133.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to be separate from our neighbours.
10k/wav/7134.wav|EN-US|EN| The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
10k/wav/7148.wav|EN-US|EN| One innate workers in Edinburgh works for standard life alone.
10k/wav/715.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be a major challenger next year.
10k/wav/7150.wav|EN-US|EN| There was some merit in that.
10k/wav/7159.wav|EN-US|EN| It's my delight on a shiny night.
10k/wav/7172.wav|EN-US|EN| I am working at the moment.
10k/wav/7174.wav|EN-US|EN| This season has been a nightmare.
10k/wav/7185.wav|EN-US|EN| We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
10k/wav/7191.wav|EN-US|EN| There are so many artists working in Glasgow
10k/wav/7198.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to speed up the process.
10k/wav/721.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
10k/wav/7212.wav|EN-US|EN| The phase of large numbers remain unknown.
10k/wav/7215.wav|EN-US|EN| I was delighted to be coming back home.
10k/wav/7217.wav|EN-US|EN| The technology looks excellent.
10k/wav/7219.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not that sort of inquiry.
10k/wav/7224.wav|EN-US|EN| Tony plus the Spexman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
10k/wav/7230.wav|EN-US|EN| It's never over until it is so though.
10k/wav/7240.wav|EN-US|EN| We always thought it should be digital and cheap.
10k/wav/7255.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a complex too.
10k/wav/7264.wav|EN-US|EN| But the next day she paid for it.
10k/wav/7289.wav|EN-US|EN| I have to say, for me, the cane was not
10k/wav/729.wav|EN-US|EN| The chief constable is right.
10k/wav/733.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to do that every week.
10k/wav/734.wav|EN-US|EN| We were desperate to get the came on.
10k/wav/7348.wav|EN-US|EN| Charles Gordon, editor of the Glasgow City Council, declined to comment.
10k/wav/7349.wav|EN-US|EN| For once it wasn't about money.
10k/wav/7362.wav|EN-US|EN| It would have taken another two months.
10k/wav/7367.wav|EN-US|EN| Was it a foul?
10k/wav/7384.wav|EN-US|EN| On reflection it was really quite exciting.
10k/wav/7387.wav|EN-US|EN| He lost the big occasions.
10k/wav/7393.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very proud of him and his achievement.
10k/wav/7394.wav|EN-US|EN| I want to get at the truth.
10k/wav/7395.wav|EN-US|EN| The results are tragic.
10k/wav/74.wav|EN-US|EN| Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
10k/wav/7402.wav|EN-US|EN| Talk of a crisis is absurd.
10k/wav/7437.wav|EN-US|EN| It was launched in February last year.
10k/wav/7448.wav|EN-US|EN| How independent is that?
10k/wav/7459.wav|EN-US|EN| So does every industry.
10k/wav/7461.wav|EN-US|EN| What is that?
10k/wav/7485.wav|EN-US|EN| But she was very human.
10k/wav/7487.wav|EN-US|EN| They are report by that.
10k/wav/7513.wav|EN-US|EN| He would have done the saint to me.
10k/wav/7518.wav|EN-US|EN| But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
10k/wav/7527.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Blur defended his wife.
10k/wav/7532.wav|EN-US|EN| Enoch is expected to come to Stanstil.
10k/wav/7557.wav|EN-US|EN| That all hope is never lost.
10k/wav/756.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not just a challenge for us.
10k/wav/7578.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no evidence.
10k/wav/7591.wav|EN-US|EN| if you look at the other calories in this area
10k/wav/7596.wav|EN-US|EN| I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
10k/wav/7608.wav|EN-US|EN| I haven't been enjoying it, though.
10k/wav/7610.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a hell of a way to lease.
10k/wav/7617.wav|EN-US|EN| But I had never been in a theatre.
10k/wav/762.wav|EN-US|EN| There were moments of few more to.
10k/wav/7626.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Stroll was home secretary at the time.
10k/wav/764.wav|EN-US|EN| We would deal first with the biggest party.
10k/wav/765.wav|EN-US|EN| We know we have the quality
10k/wav/7688.wav|EN-US|EN| We were working on it night and day.
10k/wav/7693.wav|EN-US|EN| He is very good at relating to adults.
10k/wav/7695.wav|EN-US|EN| I find the hell fanta's tubbin.
10k/wav/7720.wav|EN-US|EN| Inclusiography is on the brink of extinction, though it's official.
10k/wav/7722.wav|EN-US|EN| He prefers to play for them.
10k/wav/7729.wav|EN-US|EN| It's thou moment of jess.
10k/wav/7744.wav|EN-US|EN| We tend to come good at the end.
10k/wav/7750.wav|EN-US|EN| Mitchell hit a post from a penalty in front
10k/wav/7754.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
10k/wav/7760.wav|EN-US|EN| I think they have to change that.
10k/wav/7764.wav|EN-US|EN| This could also affect the sentencing.
10k/wav/7801.wav|EN-US|EN| The best team won.
10k/wav/7807.wav|EN-US|EN| They may yet have the last laugh.
10k/wav/7808.wav|EN-US|EN| It goes with the job.
10k/wav/7809.wav|EN-US|EN| Some of their play seemed almost set.
10k/wav/7813.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel as she had done nothing about it.
10k/wav/7824.wav|EN-US|EN| I can handle the pace.
10k/wav/7835.wav|EN-US|EN| Some old favourites remain varying forms.
10k/wav/7836.wav|EN-US|EN| Cospetuals offer there.
10k/wav/785.wav|EN-US|EN| The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
10k/wav/7864.wav|EN-US|EN| You need to trademark.
10k/wav/7867.wav|EN-US|EN| But first it goes that on TV.
10k/wav/7911.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a disaster area.
10k/wav/7917.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, was it?
10k/wav/7919.wav|EN-US|EN| We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
10k/wav/7925.wav|EN-US|EN| It's too early to say whether a public inquiry will be appropriate.
10k/wav/7940.wav|EN-US|EN| It goes in cycles.
10k/wav/7941.wav|EN-US|EN| They will not be allowed to succeed.
10k/wav/7953.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Smith declined to comment.
10k/wav/797.wav|EN-US|EN| Color is another problem.
10k/wav/7974.wav|EN-US|EN| That is important for the club.
10k/wav/8000.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a lot of confidence in this team.
10k/wav/8003.wav|EN-US|EN| At the core of these issues are rail people with rail jobs.
10k/wav/8009.wav|EN-US|EN| Would he ever go back to the beginning?
10k/wav/8017.wav|EN-US|EN| But everyone bays ways.
10k/wav/8021.wav|EN-US|EN| He gets his moment.
10k/wav/8036.wav|EN-US|EN| I have had a wonderful Claire.
10k/wav/8037.wav|EN-US|EN| The demand is created by the supply
10k/wav/8059.wav|EN-US|EN| But he admits he is deeply upset.
10k/wav/8073.wav|EN-US|EN| We continue to hold the shells.
10k/wav/8076.wav|EN-US|EN| We were completely tapped late.
10k/wav/8088.wav|EN-US|EN| Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
10k/wav/8098.wav|EN-US|EN| We must not give in to the bastards.
10k/wav/8109.wav|EN-US|EN| I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
10k/wav/8110.wav|EN-US|EN| Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
10k/wav/8116.wav|EN-US|EN| Without approval, this port will find it difficult to develop.
10k/wav/812.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a second insight.
10k/wav/8122.wav|EN-US|EN| That is completely against Islam.
10k/wav/8146.wav|EN-US|EN| Now that is a kuteo.
10k/wav/8157.wav|EN-US|EN| We should not bring him into dispute.
10k/wav/8165.wav|EN-US|EN| They married in August last year.
10k/wav/817.wav|EN-US|EN| It brings together two essential elements.
10k/wav/8180.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm really looking forward to that.
10k/wav/8182.wav|EN-US|EN| We just did not want to believe it.
10k/wav/8183.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the difference today.
10k/wav/8185.wav|EN-US|EN| I descend back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
10k/wav/8191.wav|EN-US|EN| The decision was left entirely to him.
10k/wav/8196.wav|EN-US|EN| The time has arrived for review
10k/wav/8200.wav|EN-US|EN| It is so damaging.
10k/wav/8205.wav|EN-US|EN| Let us hope so.
10k/wav/8237.wav|EN-US|EN| We were very close.
10k/wav/8250.wav|EN-US|EN| We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
10k/wav/8253.wav|EN-US|EN| The herring was due to continue today.
10k/wav/8263.wav|EN-US|EN| I know my sense.
10k/wav/827.wav|EN-US|EN| It really is a gift to the world.
10k/wav/8281.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday it was a statement of intent.
10k/wav/8284.wav|EN-US|EN| He had an appointment ready.
10k/wav/8290.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a fantasy.
10k/wav/8300.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been wanting to buy one for the National Gallery.
10k/wav/8306.wav|EN-US|EN| Can the parallel with football can be drawn?
10k/wav/8307.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a surprising decision.
10k/wav/8322.wav|EN-US|EN| This means that our programme is quite unusual.
10k/wav/8336.wav|EN-US|EN| It's more relaxing this way.
10k/wav/8337.wav|EN-US|EN| And this was one end
10k/wav/8354.wav|EN-US|EN| He takes time out for everyone.
10k/wav/8382.wav|EN-US|EN| The idea has potential for the future.
10k/wav/8410.wav|EN-US|EN| He doesn't like the Labour Party.
10k/wav/8415.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.
10k/wav/8459.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to be realistic.
10k/wav/8479.wav|EN-US|EN| Our team is just so young
10k/wav/8493.wav|EN-US|EN| The outcome pain is not over yet.
10k/wav/850.wav|EN-US|EN| The pressure on the players will build.
10k/wav/8500.wav|EN-US|EN| Then they killed another three.
10k/wav/8505.wav|EN-US|EN| They are working very well.
10k/wav/853.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all happening at a local level.
10k/wav/8545.wav|EN-US|EN| The official also said no gropes have made any terrorist claims involving the crash.
10k/wav/8564.wav|EN-US|EN| I've just got to build on this now.
10k/wav/8578.wav|EN-US|EN| Cinema is a communal experience.
10k/wav/858.wav|EN-US|EN| She was a delightful person.
10k/wav/8583.wav|EN-US|EN| Talks have continued at many different levels.
10k/wav/8592.wav|EN-US|EN| They were unable to revive him.
10k/wav/860.wav|EN-US|EN| One woman refused to sit down.
10k/wav/8604.wav|EN-US|EN| He was not alone at the top of the port.
10k/wav/8613.wav|EN-US|EN| We aren't going to play better.
10k/wav/8614.wav|EN-US|EN| He had served his time.
10k/wav/8616.wav|EN-US|EN| The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
10k/wav/8618.wav|EN-US|EN| The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures
10k/wav/8621.wav|EN-US|EN| Completion is expected by October the following year.
10k/wav/8625.wav|EN-US|EN| A tendency at the project is a condition of a probation order.
10k/wav/865.wav|EN-US|EN| Johnny Wilkinson had an off day on Saturday.
10k/wav/8651.wav|EN-US|EN| Then neither I wanted to do something.
10k/wav/8653.wav|EN-US|EN| It is giving out the wrong message.
10k/wav/8676.wav|EN-US|EN| Who would be in that desert?
10k/wav/8683.wav|EN-US|EN| The attack was totally unprovoked.
10k/wav/8695.wav|EN-US|EN| It gave no further details.
10k/wav/8728.wav|EN-US|EN| I look sure that is not.
10k/wav/8736.wav|EN-US|EN| Just one of those things, we suppose.
10k/wav/8764.wav|EN-US|EN| I was not overly concerned about this.
10k/wav/8781.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe dispatch will have been.
10k/wav/8785.wav|EN-US|EN| He was then replaced by Ross.
10k/wav/8798.wav|EN-US|EN| We have managed to get it under control.
10k/wav/88.wav|EN-US|EN| He quit in October.
10k/wav/880.wav|EN-US|EN| I wish I could say something.
10k/wav/8804.wav|EN-US|EN| The results at Domo will focus on the company's strategy.
10k/wav/8819.wav|EN-US|EN| The city welcomed the bright outlook.
10k/wav/8829.wav|EN-US|EN| He is married with three children.
10k/wav/8832.wav|EN-US|EN| At the time, he was a living legend.
10k/wav/8851.wav|EN-US|EN| That's what lies ahead.
10k/wav/8862.wav|EN-US|EN| So please said nobody had been found.
10k/wav/8868.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never seen anything like it
10k/wav/8877.wav|EN-US|EN| The others have all been in storage for some time.
10k/wav/8898.wav|EN-US|EN| Is he conscious?
10k/wav/8900.wav|EN-US|EN| Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come
10k/wav/8901.wav|EN-US|EN| They could not her.
10k/wav/892.wav|EN-US|EN| And we will do it.
10k/wav/894.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a moral dilemma.
10k/wav/8940.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't get to keep it.
10k/wav/8952.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd like to take the plunge.
10k/wav/8961.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, it is a tough assignment.
10k/wav/8962.wav|EN-US|EN| The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
10k/wav/8965.wav|EN-US|EN| Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
10k/wav/8973.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
10k/wav/8989.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
10k/wav/8994.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be stronger in Berlin
10k/wav/8996.wav|EN-US|EN| These old songs are very nice to play
10k/wav/900.wav|EN-US|EN| She was so supportive.
10k/wav/9003.wav|EN-US|EN| It was that kind of much.
10k/wav/9004.wav|EN-US|EN| Okan Ondokol, at every levels, he delivered the cups.
10k/wav/9005.wav|EN-US|EN| Nast, it was too short tonight.
10k/wav/901.wav|EN-US|EN| The church was really nice.
10k/wav/902.wav|EN-US|EN| She is also claiming constructive and infodismissile.
10k/wav/9037.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a financial matter.
10k/wav/9060.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not an improvement for them.
10k/wav/9066.wav|EN-US|EN| Later we discovered it was a hoax.
10k/wav/907.wav|EN-US|EN| We are looking for volunteers.
10k/wav/9073.wav|EN-US|EN| It divided audiences at Cannes.
10k/wav/908.wav|EN-US|EN| The British people are the boss.
10k/wav/9081.wav|EN-US|EN| He distorted on the subseats.
10k/wav/9094.wav|EN-US|EN| This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
10k/wav/9112.wav|EN-US|EN| You name it. They have it.
10k/wav/9115.wav|EN-US|EN| I am interested in all kinds of history.
10k/wav/9129.wav|EN-US|EN| The Union has threatened to strike action unless these demands are met.
10k/wav/9132.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very much in the of the individual.
10k/wav/9144.wav|EN-US|EN| It is tough, but possible.
10k/wav/9153.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
10k/wav/9155.wav|EN-US|EN| What does he want him to look like?
10k/wav/9175.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it's a miracle.
10k/wav/9185.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no hard words between us.
10k/wav/9198.wav|EN-US|EN| The proposals were not near.
10k/wav/9222.wav|EN-US|EN| I will not walk away from this job.
10k/wav/9235.wav|EN-US|EN| It's up to them.
10k/wav/9239.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday he was busy in his office.
10k/wav/9252.wav|EN-US|EN| It is actually building on the existing business.
10k/wav/9267.wav|EN-US|EN| All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
10k/wav/9268.wav|EN-US|EN| They offered to make an investment into it.
10k/wav/9269.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm about protecting the state pension.
10k/wav/9270.wav|EN-US|EN| He should have asked for second opinion.
10k/wav/9278.wav|EN-US|EN| She went home from school and never returned.
10k/wav/9285.wav|EN-US|EN| But the roll off used to go away
10k/wav/9289.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not too bad.
10k/wav/929.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm glad I came.
10k/wav/9291.wav|EN-US|EN| They have brought in the replacement.
10k/wav/9298.wav|EN-US|EN| But who is it?
10k/wav/930.wav|EN-US|EN| turnover was highest in telecoms.
10k/wav/9320.wav|EN-US|EN| I told him I was a long time ago.
10k/wav/9332.wav|EN-US|EN| Henny was strong and talented.
10k/wav/9333.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never been unemployed.
10k/wav/9346.wav|EN-US|EN| He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
10k/wav/9348.wav|EN-US|EN| This is certainly not the timer for attempts at trial by media.
10k/wav/9350.wav|EN-US|EN| This morning was very quiet.
10k/wav/9356.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone thought they were safe.
10k/wav/9367.wav|EN-US|EN| Being a taxi driver out there is horrible.
10k/wav/9370.wav|EN-US|EN| This isn't a new problem.
10k/wav/9381.wav|EN-US|EN| According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
10k/wav/9391.wav|EN-US|EN| His death was a tragic accident.
10k/wav/9394.wav|EN-US|EN| We were going to change our party.
10k/wav/9398.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, it had to be something that's for sure.
10k/wav/9415.wav|EN-US|EN| I drove the ball well.
10k/wav/9428.wav|EN-US|EN| ytt is to win
10k/wav/943.wav|EN-US|EN| However, this concern appears to be misguided
10k/wav/9450.wav|EN-US|EN| Life is too short.
10k/wav/9451.wav|EN-US|EN| Its primary business channel is the internet
10k/wav/9453.wav|EN-US|EN| The balance is all wrong in this country.
10k/wav/948.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland has shown the way.
10k/wav/9482.wav|EN-US|EN| No date has been fixed for his return.
10k/wav/9491.wav|EN-US|EN| The referee is there to decide these things.
10k/wav/9493.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat
10k/wav/9501.wav|EN-US|EN| This was repeated the second time.
10k/wav/9507.wav|EN-US|EN| He has run a hell of a race.
10k/wav/9528.wav|EN-US|EN| You are different people.
10k/wav/954.wav|EN-US|EN| It is part of our heritage.
10k/wav/9547.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be pleased to talk to them.
10k/wav/9553.wav|EN-US|EN| He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
10k/wav/9561.wav|EN-US|EN| She is on the life support machine.
10k/wav/9562.wav|EN-US|EN| It should be scrapped.
10k/wav/9578.wav|EN-US|EN| We can only gulp.
10k/wav/9579.wav|EN-US|EN| It's almost certainly not going to help.
10k/wav/9594.wav|EN-US|EN| He was right, of course.
10k/wav/9595.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that our people we want?
10k/wav/960.wav|EN-US|EN| He is not a dancer.
10k/wav/9600.wav|EN-US|EN| Confidence is as low as it can get.
10k/wav/9602.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very difficult to find a buyer.
10k/wav/962.wav|EN-US|EN| and suddenly it became a free for all.
10k/wav/9639.wav|EN-US|EN| They were virtually part, together as a pup.
10k/wav/9647.wav|EN-US|EN| The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
10k/wav/9655.wav|EN-US|EN| He would die to fault you.
10k/wav/966.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
10k/wav/9662.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't see myself in one of these.
10k/wav/9671.wav|EN-US|EN| They tried to deny it.
10k/wav/9694.wav|EN-US|EN| Neil is never going to come back.
10k/wav/971.wav|EN-US|EN| It is quite an opener.
10k/wav/9710.wav|EN-US|EN| She has left the wound.
10k/wav/9722.wav|EN-US|EN| She came to the Harlem show.
10k/wav/9729.wav|EN-US|EN| It is sponsored by The Herald.
10k/wav/9742.wav|EN-US|EN| Sussex police refused to give any further details.
10k/wav/9755.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the lot of it came on.
10k/wav/9763.wav|EN-US|EN| The family baton is handed on.
10k/wav/9766.wav|EN-US|EN| And he's the real thing.
10k/wav/9769.wav|EN-US|EN| The gaffer was great.
10k/wav/977.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it's a great system.
10k/wav/9770.wav|EN-US|EN| Now there's an even bigger target.
10k/wav/9805.wav|EN-US|EN| I think the Scottish bit is very strong.
10k/wav/9806.wav|EN-US|EN| No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
10k/wav/9810.wav|EN-US|EN| Labour has been found out on public spending.
10k/wav/9816.wav|EN-US|EN| Certainly in Tom's of League position. We must be favourites.
10k/wav/9834.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a problem for me.
10k/wav/9837.wav|EN-US|EN| Why you did it will never be known.
10k/wav/9841.wav|EN-US|EN| I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
10k/wav/9866.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a great evening.
10k/wav/987.wav|EN-US|EN| We are just waiting for news.
10k/wav/9876.wav|EN-US|EN| As a nation, we must become more active.
10k/wav/9880.wav|EN-US|EN| Says the Duke of Walk.
10k/wav/9886.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
10k/wav/9887.wav|EN-US|EN| It being the weekend, there was no one thou
10k/wav/989.wav|EN-US|EN| He refused to name the survivors.
10k/wav/9909.wav|EN-US|EN| The party is up for it.
10k/wav/9912.wav|EN-US|EN| The refund is fully justified.
10k/wav/9915.wav|EN-US|EN| Y position on the euro is quite clear.
10k/wav/9918.wav|EN-US|EN| They should be looking at us victims.
10k/wav/9920.wav|EN-US|EN| I can't tell this sort of stuff.
10k/wav/9929.wav|EN-US|EN| We talk about effective military action.
10k/wav/9930.wav|EN-US|EN| That is highly unfair.
10k/wav/9934.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still suffering from that.
10k/wav/9941.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly the jury were not convinced.
10k/wav/9942.wav|EN-US|EN| As a school teacher, he was an excellent coach.
10k/wav/9958.wav|EN-US|EN| But they had up.
10k/wav/9967.wav|EN-US|EN| There's still no one like him.
10k/wav/9972.wav|EN-US|EN| You have got to be careful.
10k/wav/9976.wav|EN-US|EN| The committees are due to report next year.
10k/wav/9980.wav|EN-US|EN| However, in Orkney there was a mixed response.
10k/wav/9992.wav|EN-US|EN| Government sources said it is building up.
10k/wav/9993.wav|EN-US|EN| He is now back in Brighton.
10k/wav/9994.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing is safe.
10k/wav/9996.wav|EN-US|EN| That, though, is the measure of the man.
10k/wav/1004.wav|EN-US|EN| He did the right thing by ignoring me.
10k/wav/1008.wav|EN-US|EN| The lights are having a toll.
10k/wav/102.wav|EN-US|EN| Strathguide, please decline to comment.
10k/wav/1028.wav|EN-US|EN| No company would want to put their people at risk.
10k/wav/1042.wav|EN-US|EN| He will now seek to sell his shows in the club.
10k/wav/1065.wav|EN-US|EN| So on the stadium front, I think we have made our case.
10k/wav/1068.wav|EN-US|EN| Still, it is a very good result for us.
10k/wav/1070.wav|EN-US|EN| Did it work?
10k/wav/1072.wav|EN-US|EN| Safety is our first concern.
10k/wav/1074.wav|EN-US|EN| I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
10k/wav/1087.wav|EN-US|EN| That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
10k/wav/1088.wav|EN-US|EN| Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
10k/wav/1097.wav|EN-US|EN| And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
10k/wav/110.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going for it.
10k/wav/1111.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish enterprise.
10k/wav/1119.wav|EN-US|EN| He became enchanted with the process.
10k/wav/1124.wav|EN-US|EN| That left a bad taste in my mouth.
10k/wav/1129.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all starting to come together.
10k/wav/1130.wav|EN-US|EN| Now we have had enough.
10k/wav/1156.wav|EN-US|EN| People want to see me on the screen.
10k/wav/1157.wav|EN-US|EN| However the problem is timing.
10k/wav/1163.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be that absurd.
10k/wav/1167.wav|EN-US|EN| We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
10k/wav/1172.wav|EN-US|EN| Night was Britain's turn.
10k/wav/1181.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a great art.
10k/wav/1187.wav|EN-US|EN| This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
10k/wav/1213.wav|EN-US|EN| Is it the players or is it the coaches?
10k/wav/1226.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel pretty good.
10k/wav/1228.wav|EN-US|EN| A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
10k/wav/1238.wav|EN-US|EN| We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
10k/wav/1239.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to keep the focus alive.
10k/wav/1245.wav|EN-US|EN| That is bad enough.
10k/wav/1246.wav|EN-US|EN| Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
10k/wav/1266.wav|EN-US|EN| We have all been there at some point.
10k/wav/1281.wav|EN-US|EN| She asked us a lot of questions.
10k/wav/1284.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure he didn't demean it.
10k/wav/13.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two things we have to do.
10k/wav/1309.wav|EN-US|EN| I was prostrated here
10k/wav/1311.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not have a better myself.
10k/wav/1313.wav|EN-US|EN| So, how will it be received in this?
10k/wav/1318.wav|EN-US|EN| His game was complete.
10k/wav/1319.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a definite penalty.
10k/wav/1335.wav|EN-US|EN| From the opening, could it be magic?
10k/wav/1340.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a very promising player indeed.
10k/wav/1343.wav|EN-US|EN| Glasgow University declined to comment.
10k/wav/1350.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not the right time for me.
10k/wav/1353.wav|EN-US|EN| Charles Gordon, Edith Glasgow City Council, declined to comment.
10k/wav/1357.wav|EN-US|EN| On that basis he would set it aside.
10k/wav/136.wav|EN-US|EN| Each day is a new beginning.
10k/wav/1370.wav|EN-US|EN| Their mandate is to target inflation.
10k/wav/1383.wav|EN-US|EN| York has no interest in war.
10k/wav/1394.wav|EN-US|EN| but they can also be managed by telephone.
10k/wav/1398.wav|EN-US|EN| The early evidence suggests he did not.
10k/wav/1404.wav|EN-US|EN| We are at the crossroads.
10k/wav/1414.wav|EN-US|EN| No one had seen this sort of thing before.
10k/wav/1425.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm extremely cautious.
10k/wav/1427.wav|EN-US|EN| His primary residence is Scotland.
10k/wav/1434.wav|EN-US|EN| When he got up he was late again.
10k/wav/1449.wav|EN-US|EN| those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
10k/wav/1452.wav|EN-US|EN| But that night they killed her housekeeper.
10k/wav/1466.wav|EN-US|EN| You remember how only lasted.
10k/wav/1467.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted to have her back home.
10k/wav/148.wav|EN-US|EN| She has a wonderful mind.
10k/wav/1490.wav|EN-US|EN| I have learned from him.
10k/wav/1499.wav|EN-US|EN| Here is a tell-off devotion to duty
10k/wav/1503.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a committed European.
10k/wav/1506.wav|EN-US|EN| Mini rugby is a great thing.
10k/wav/1522.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you think you have a shot?
10k/wav/1525.wav|EN-US|EN| The children were later able to leave by bus.
10k/wav/1535.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all been about the basics of the business.
10k/wav/1547.wav|EN-US|EN| He may have a long wait.
10k/wav/1550.wav|EN-US|EN| He's on the wrong side
10k/wav/1553.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a great day.
10k/wav/1579.wav|EN-US|EN| What's happening to her?
10k/wav/158.wav|EN-US|EN| No one else is like Michael Jackson.
10k/wav/160.wav|EN-US|EN| Casualties are a problem for the Kremen
10k/wav/1602.wav|EN-US|EN| It could have been prevented.
10k/wav/1612.wav|EN-US|EN| I suspect that it would.
10k/wav/1615.wav|EN-US|EN| My daughter was really, really innocent.
10k/wav/1634.wav|EN-US|EN| We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
10k/wav/1636.wav|EN-US|EN| Once again he refused.
10k/wav/1649.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a terrible thing to have happened.
10k/wav/1653.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows that we are a civilist society.
10k/wav/166.wav|EN-US|EN| Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
10k/wav/1678.wav|EN-US|EN| We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
10k/wav/1684.wav|EN-US|EN| They will have five minutes to decide.
10k/wav/1694.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not their fault.
10k/wav/170.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe it would have been successful.
10k/wav/1705.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still seeking that complete performance.
10k/wav/1707.wav|EN-US|EN| The police enquiry begun about two weeks before the Chernom election.
10k/wav/1718.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
10k/wav/1731.wav|EN-US|EN| I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
10k/wav/1735.wav|EN-US|EN| Tie goes the exception.
10k/wav/174.wav|EN-US|EN| It would have very little impact on them.
10k/wav/1747.wav|EN-US|EN| You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
10k/wav/1763.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no respite.
10k/wav/1767.wav|EN-US|EN| We make good weapons.
10k/wav/1769.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
10k/wav/178.wav|EN-US|EN| As you see with the Feralgity business, they do.
10k/wav/1780.wav|EN-US|EN| The other was a football match.
10k/wav/1793.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not in my nature.
10k/wav/1797.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to do that.
10k/wav/1802.wav|EN-US|EN| Surely it can do better than that.
10k/wav/1809.wav|EN-US|EN| It was deployed in the Gulf War.
10k/wav/1810.wav|EN-US|EN| We'll watch the same merch.
10k/wav/1823.wav|EN-US|EN| The Premier League has been a huge success.
10k/wav/1831.wav|EN-US|EN| He urged people to forgive.
10k/wav/1838.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a fire game.
10k/wav/188.wav|EN-US|EN| We should recognise others have done a good job.
10k/wav/1888.wav|EN-US|EN| The price was risked after massive demand from retail investors.
10k/wav/1891.wav|EN-US|EN| It really has left the town in shock
10k/wav/1897.wav|EN-US|EN| It is each.
10k/wav/1909.wav|EN-US|EN| If we live forever, can we be set to leave?
10k/wav/1916.wav|EN-US|EN| But not every story is a success story.
10k/wav/1918.wav|EN-US|EN| When you do you will never want to do any other job.
10k/wav/1929.wav|EN-US|EN| The team is in division 1 in Spain.
10k/wav/193.wav|EN-US|EN| She has seen, or heard it all.
10k/wav/1930.wav|EN-US|EN| A film is different from a book.
10k/wav/1932.wav|EN-US|EN| We put our bed in last night.
10k/wav/1934.wav|EN-US|EN| I was never in danger.
10k/wav/1942.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to keep our clients.
10k/wav/1951.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know the farewell story.
10k/wav/1976.wav|EN-US|EN| I think. Therefore I am.
10k/wav/1982.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very dangerous for markets.
10k/wav/1983.wav|EN-US|EN| I chose the former.
10k/wav/1996.wav|EN-US|EN| Left is good.
10k/wav/1998.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not going to sit back.
10k/wav/2000.wav|EN-US|EN| What is the worth?
10k/wav/201.wav|EN-US|EN| I can leave at the end of the day.
10k/wav/2014.wav|EN-US|EN| Have you been thinking about it for a year?
10k/wav/2043.wav|EN-US|EN| Divisions were put in place.
10k/wav/2049.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the light relief.
10k/wav/2055.wav|EN-US|EN| He can handle it without any problem.
10k/wav/2063.wav|EN-US|EN| The six others were injured.
10k/wav/21.wav|EN-US|EN| We must not go down that road.
10k/wav/2109.wav|EN-US|EN| I had found my vision.
10k/wav/2116.wav|EN-US|EN| A good actor doesn't think.
10k/wav/2122.wav|EN-US|EN| We are looking very hard at ourselves.
10k/wav/2145.wav|EN-US|EN| But it will backfire.
10k/wav/216.wav|EN-US|EN| The gap is closing.
10k/wav/2164.wav|EN-US|EN| Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
10k/wav/2166.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not sure.
10k/wav/2170.wav|EN-US|EN| You have obviously got an ass at it.
10k/wav/2182.wav|EN-US|EN| This can only help us go forward.
10k/wav/2202.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't want any trouble.
10k/wav/2213.wav|EN-US|EN| The drivers had an awful lot of Vebula Peace.
10k/wav/2214.wav|EN-US|EN| It would last five months.
10k/wav/2226.wav|EN-US|EN| These figures are truly awful.
10k/wav/2243.wav|EN-US|EN| This man is serious about his work.
10k/wav/2246.wav|EN-US|EN| It's so dumb apart.
10k/wav/2258.wav|EN-US|EN| Our future is in their hands.
10k/wav/2264.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it was briefly considered.
10k/wav/2272.wav|EN-US|EN| I think there's not much between them.
10k/wav/2274.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the agreement with the manager.
10k/wav/2278.wav|EN-US|EN| It just got out of control.
10k/wav/229.wav|EN-US|EN| It has affected it obviously.
10k/wav/2296.wav|EN-US|EN| It was only logical to end it.
10k/wav/2302.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still in the process of making changes.
10k/wav/2321.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not good at all.
10k/wav/2333.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a little bit tired
10k/wav/2342.wav|EN-US|EN| My ambition is to make the cut.
10k/wav/2350.wav|EN-US|EN| The sticks are high.
10k/wav/2352.wav|EN-US|EN| That has to be allowed.
10k/wav/2353.wav|EN-US|EN| Thus the story will continue to thrive.
10k/wav/2360.wav|EN-US|EN| It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
10k/wav/238.wav|EN-US|EN| They made clear that they are not interested in government assistance.
10k/wav/2409.wav|EN-US|EN| It is an absolute disgrace.
10k/wav/242.wav|EN-US|EN| Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
10k/wav/2420.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going to change our party.
10k/wav/2435.wav|EN-US|EN| They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
10k/wav/2437.wav|EN-US|EN| Would you be here for the weekend?
10k/wav/2458.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt very strongly that England should have it.
10k/wav/2460.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a sign of the times.
10k/wav/2461.wav|EN-US|EN| Still, he did not let himself down this week.
10k/wav/2463.wav|EN-US|EN| Since then, physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10k/wav/2467.wav|EN-US|EN| Where can have that effect on some citizens?
10k/wav/2510.wav|EN-US|EN| We regret that they's brought in the first place.
10k/wav/2511.wav|EN-US|EN| It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
10k/wav/2536.wav|EN-US|EN| He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
10k/wav/2543.wav|EN-US|EN| It is no surprise.
10k/wav/2568.wav|EN-US|EN| In my experience, he does not do that.
10k/wav/257.wav|EN-US|EN| I lost it at the final whistle.
10k/wav/2573.wav|EN-US|EN| All men of precaution and protection are taken.
10k/wav/2584.wav|EN-US|EN| Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
10k/wav/2596.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not alive.
10k/wav/26.wav|EN-US|EN| The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
10k/wav/2622.wav|EN-US|EN| It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
10k/wav/2628.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't like to fail.
10k/wav/2634.wav|EN-US|EN| She was on the edge of breaking point.
10k/wav/2636.wav|EN-US|EN| Industry Leaders React to Dankerly
10k/wav/2649.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just another play.
10k/wav/2665.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not asking for the Moon.
10k/wav/2667.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not very pretty but it's effective.
10k/wav/2673.wav|EN-US|EN| This should come as no surprise.
10k/wav/2685.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not done so this season so far.
10k/wav/2687.wav|EN-US|EN| What did we learn?
10k/wav/2707.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be a masterclass.
10k/wav/2714.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm immensely sat.
10k/wav/274.wav|EN-US|EN| The message is just not getting through.
10k/wav/2743.wav|EN-US|EN| There's the story too.
10k/wav/2757.wav|EN-US|EN| Neatings will also remain private.
10k/wav/2775.wav|EN-US|EN| The bank was now involved.
10k/wav/2779.wav|EN-US|EN| I have every confidence.
10k/wav/279.wav|EN-US|EN| The squad will be the same for France.
10k/wav/28.wav|EN-US|EN| He scored a touchdown.
10k/wav/2809.wav|EN-US|EN| Here is a question for you.
10k/wav/2812.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm still very much a director.
10k/wav/2816.wav|EN-US|EN| You can't have it both ways.
10k/wav/2831.wav|EN-US|EN| However, you have just got to adjust it.
10k/wav/2836.wav|EN-US|EN| This would include the Gampi food industry.
10k/wav/2858.wav|EN-US|EN| She is employed on short-term contracts.
10k/wav/2861.wav|EN-US|EN| He should have won.
10k/wav/2890.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a very special unit.
10k/wav/2915.wav|EN-US|EN| This is an awful lot of money.
10k/wav/2926.wav|EN-US|EN| It's too horrible to think.
10k/wav/2935.wav|EN-US|EN| Pensions have been hit in the headlines.
10k/wav/294.wav|EN-US|EN| They might surprise themselves.
10k/wav/2945.wav|EN-US|EN| We just want the season to end.
10k/wav/2947.wav|EN-US|EN| This will take several weeks.
10k/wav/2950.wav|EN-US|EN| I could live without the attention he admitted.
10k/wav/2951.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no openness.
10k/wav/299.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't see him reversing that.
10k/wav/2997.wav|EN-US|EN| He declined to provide a breakdown.
10k/wav/3015.wav|EN-US|EN| With Ray talking about the outskirts of London.
10k/wav/3019.wav|EN-US|EN| They were outstanding and totally deserved their win.
10k/wav/3020.wav|EN-US|EN| The most important thing was to win today.
10k/wav/3024.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a visionary.
10k/wav/3029.wav|EN-US|EN| The scientific debate is dead.
10k/wav/3036.wav|EN-US|EN| It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
10k/wav/3073.wav|EN-US|EN| We will deliver at director level.
10k/wav/3079.wav|EN-US|EN| It is already making a difference.
10k/wav/3084.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just an accident of birth.
10k/wav/309.wav|EN-US|EN| The girls will come.
10k/wav/3093.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no time, Miss Kea.
10k/wav/3112.wav|EN-US|EN| British officials said they could not say.
10k/wav/3117.wav|EN-US|EN| The palmist said the queen was dupi sardined.
10k/wav/3119.wav|EN-US|EN| It's fantastic to win again.
10k/wav/3133.wav|EN-US|EN| as if he were a high court judge.
10k/wav/3139.wav|EN-US|EN| We are looking for unity in the council.
10k/wav/3141.wav|EN-US|EN| The government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save them.
10k/wav/3150.wav|EN-US|EN| It's as simple as that.
10k/wav/3152.wav|EN-US|EN| Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
10k/wav/3160.wav|EN-US|EN| We are working on it.
10k/wav/3161.wav|EN-US|EN| But they also came with a dance site.
10k/wav/3215.wav|EN-US|EN| Cells have been perfectly buoyant.
10k/wav/3221.wav|EN-US|EN| They had to have hospital treatment.
10k/wav/3225.wav|EN-US|EN| Then that's one way people play for fun.
10k/wav/3230.wav|EN-US|EN| But after a dip in sales, grief was recorded.
10k/wav/3236.wav|EN-US|EN| However, a bit was never made
10k/wav/3240.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very fast.
10k/wav/3242.wav|EN-US|EN| She continued to enjoy sport.
10k/wav/3243.wav|EN-US|EN| They want to play in the World Cup.
10k/wav/3254.wav|EN-US|EN| The answer was in space.
10k/wav/3263.wav|EN-US|EN| But you never won any games.
10k/wav/3284.wav|EN-US|EN| There is some light in the tunnel.
10k/wav/3285.wav|EN-US|EN| Inside, there is a kind of madness
10k/wav/3302.wav|EN-US|EN| holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry
10k/wav/3306.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope we can put it behind us.
10k/wav/3307.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to find out what went wrong.
10k/wav/3309.wav|EN-US|EN| His third child was born in Aprilia.
10k/wav/3312.wav|EN-US|EN| The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
10k/wav/3326.wav|EN-US|EN| We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
10k/wav/3331.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never felt affection for him here.
10k/wav/3332.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim
10k/wav/334.wav|EN-US|EN| He was made redundant in February of last year.
10k/wav/3349.wav|EN-US|EN| The farmer wants a new campaign.
10k/wav/3356.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a delight on every level.
10k/wav/3359.wav|EN-US|EN| We should be clear about the role of government.
10k/wav/3362.wav|EN-US|EN| He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
10k/wav/3364.wav|EN-US|EN| We can do both.
10k/wav/3365.wav|EN-US|EN| The website is now being amended.
10k/wav/3389.wav|EN-US|EN| dialogue is the key
10k/wav/3390.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a record label, not a form of music.
10k/wav/3396.wav|EN-US|EN| They must be on commission.
10k/wav/3417.wav|EN-US|EN| That used to be another thing of mine.
10k/wav/3440.wav|EN-US|EN| I picked the Troying Town.
10k/wav/3445.wav|EN-US|EN| Previously, they were arrested in the European Court of Human Rights.
10k/wav/345.wav|EN-US|EN| In a bar sound.
10k/wav/3450.wav|EN-US|EN| If it does it means he has failed
10k/wav/3458.wav|EN-US|EN| There will always be problems on the way.
10k/wav/3473.wav|EN-US|EN| The Princess has had other health problems.
10k/wav/35.wav|EN-US|EN| No, they are not the same thing.
10k/wav/3506.wav|EN-US|EN| We must look forward.
10k/wav/3509.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got to deal with it.
10k/wav/3512.wav|EN-US|EN| The break down was much later in her life.
10k/wav/3530.wav|EN-US|EN| We have done our own tests.
10k/wav/3537.wav|EN-US|EN| Every character was completely different.
10k/wav/3538.wav|EN-US|EN| He has lost confidence and weight.
10k/wav/3550.wav|EN-US|EN| Such is the scene of the tragedy.
10k/wav/3552.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two games to go after that.
10k/wav/3559.wav|EN-US|EN| The column was perfect.
10k/wav/3561.wav|EN-US|EN| We were upset about the referee.
10k/wav/3562.wav|EN-US|EN| But not always so defined.
10k/wav/3572.wav|EN-US|EN| I was all alone.
10k/wav/3589.wav|EN-US|EN| Her husband had been waiting for her return.
10k/wav/3627.wav|EN-US|EN| Elections would fall in about two years.
10k/wav/3639.wav|EN-US|EN| Others were in hygiene, in fur of their lives.
10k/wav/3650.wav|EN-US|EN| That is our objective.
10k/wav/3652.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought he might have been a bit.
10k/wav/3675.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the wealthiest in Europe.
10k/wav/369.wav|EN-US|EN| But I know the course.
10k/wav/3709.wav|EN-US|EN| Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the Church.
10k/wav/3711.wav|EN-US|EN| When I was four years old, I used to do like this.
10k/wav/3712.wav|EN-US|EN| Now that was a boxing movie.
10k/wav/3716.wav|EN-US|EN| It's always the next century
10k/wav/3721.wav|EN-US|EN| Bredilos, to Solovon, landfill.
10k/wav/3738.wav|EN-US|EN| Seeing the hill country will be level.
10k/wav/3749.wav|EN-US|EN| I was pregnant and very late.
10k/wav/3750.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just an area of water.
10k/wav/3757.wav|EN-US|EN| We could hardly believe it.
10k/wav/3780.wav|EN-US|EN| Obviously, people await in the West Midlands.
10k/wav/3782.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly, their house got away with murder.
10k/wav/3802.wav|EN-US|EN| Checkmate common is the obvious choice.
10k/wav/3821.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been declared.
10k/wav/3837.wav|EN-US|EN| He also coordinated another form.
10k/wav/3845.wav|EN-US|EN| Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
10k/wav/3854.wav|EN-US|EN| We fit under corner.
10k/wav/3859.wav|EN-US|EN| There wasn't a goal.
10k/wav/386.wav|EN-US|EN| A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
10k/wav/3873.wav|EN-US|EN| We are all in the front line.
10k/wav/3888.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not there yet, but it is close.
10k/wav/39.wav|EN-US|EN| Poptilin's getting old
10k/wav/3917.wav|EN-US|EN| We are taking the backseat on this.
10k/wav/3940.wav|EN-US|EN| That's why they go to the Opry.
10k/wav/3955.wav|EN-US|EN| But the casting is also bizarre.
10k/wav/396.wav|EN-US|EN| I have had a lovely summer.
10k/wav/3962.wav|EN-US|EN| How things have changed since then.
10k/wav/397.wav|EN-US|EN| But he kept on repeating it.
10k/wav/3975.wav|EN-US|EN| It became a book by itself.
10k/wav/3978.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going to have a party.
10k/wav/3981.wav|EN-US|EN| This looks like it is anything but open.
10k/wav/3991.wav|EN-US|EN| A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
10k/wav/3993.wav|EN-US|EN| The World Trade Centre was Almond Street.
10k/wav/3998.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think we deserve to lose.
10k/wav/4007.wav|EN-US|EN| He must have something up his sleeve.
10k/wav/4038.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a terrible place.
10k/wav/4049.wav|EN-US|EN| It would help to heal the moods.
10k/wav/4065.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a Socialist.
10k/wav/4071.wav|EN-US|EN| So I left.
10k/wav/4073.wav|EN-US|EN| Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
10k/wav/4083.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think they are too serious.
10k/wav/4085.wav|EN-US|EN| Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
10k/wav/4088.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem was you thought you were a big man.
10k/wav/4093.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to work.
10k/wav/4111.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the whole package.
10k/wav/412.wav|EN-US|EN| If convicted, they face the death penalty.
10k/wav/4130.wav|EN-US|EN| The show is not over.
10k/wav/4134.wav|EN-US|EN| Angels can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
10k/wav/4137.wav|EN-US|EN| Please want to know what is on offer.
10k/wav/4171.wav|EN-US|EN| This was certainly not about money.
10k/wav/4181.wav|EN-US|EN| There was pressure from elsewhere too.
10k/wav/4204.wav|EN-US|EN| We are happy with the referee.
10k/wav/421.wav|EN-US|EN| Injuries have taken their toll.
10k/wav/4219.wav|EN-US|EN| There is another site to it
10k/wav/4230.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to be funded.
10k/wav/4241.wav|EN-US|EN| Nor was it a game without its lessons.
10k/wav/4255.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the source of deep concern.
10k/wav/427.wav|EN-US|EN| We reckon we can do very well.
10k/wav/4281.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't good, but we will get better.
10k/wav/4296.wav|EN-US|EN| As long as it is possible we will keep going.
10k/wav/4339.wav|EN-US|EN| His party never arrived.
10k/wav/4342.wav|EN-US|EN| There are no charges
10k/wav/4367.wav|EN-US|EN| We are enabled to provide support for future issues.
10k/wav/4373.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a hit.
10k/wav/4379.wav|EN-US|EN| There were also some interesting questions and answers.
10k/wav/4402.wav|EN-US|EN| Who was being affected?
10k/wav/4407.wav|EN-US|EN| I lost a pot of me.
10k/wav/4408.wav|EN-US|EN| Patalan is Deji's series.
10k/wav/4413.wav|EN-US|EN| At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing
10k/wav/4414.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland is too small a country for that.
10k/wav/4430.wav|EN-US|EN| This fact is supported by audience research.
10k/wav/4448.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no evidence of a little Scotland emerging.
10k/wav/4455.wav|EN-US|EN| She is county in foster care.
10k/wav/4460.wav|EN-US|EN| He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
10k/wav/4488.wav|EN-US|EN| And maybe they have.
10k/wav/4498.wav|EN-US|EN| Sarchain attack is bizarre.
10k/wav/450.wav|EN-US|EN| But the surprise is in store.
10k/wav/4501.wav|EN-US|EN| You've got to be vigilant.
10k/wav/4503.wav|EN-US|EN| I just have to accept that.
10k/wav/4532.wav|EN-US|EN| When is Inerrup of Scotland is high?
10k/wav/4554.wav|EN-US|EN| The procedure is the same in all cases.
10k/wav/4555.wav|EN-US|EN| What are you not good at?
10k/wav/4558.wav|EN-US|EN| We are satisfied that this is the case.
10k/wav/4560.wav|EN-US|EN| I have decided to stand down from the list.
10k/wav/4563.wav|EN-US|EN| The weather forecast isn't good.
10k/wav/4576.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a matter for Westminster.
10k/wav/4581.wav|EN-US|EN| What will it be?
10k/wav/4590.wav|EN-US|EN| While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
10k/wav/4610.wav|EN-US|EN| Even then it might be difficult.
10k/wav/4621.wav|EN-US|EN| The statement was a lie.
10k/wav/4636.wav|EN-US|EN| The trouble is, there is no simple solution.
10k/wav/4646.wav|EN-US|EN| They need to be helped.
10k/wav/4647.wav|EN-US|EN| The farmer wants a new campaign.
10k/wav/4661.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the same alt story.
10k/wav/4668.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no back potato.
10k/wav/468.wav|EN-US|EN| Pop Dylan is getting old.
10k/wav/4680.wav|EN-US|EN| Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
10k/wav/4692.wav|EN-US|EN| And they all had these other commitments.
10k/wav/4695.wav|EN-US|EN| We should have known.
10k/wav/4697.wav|EN-US|EN| You feel very helpless.
10k/wav/4700.wav|EN-US|EN| He did his best but it wasn't good enough.
10k/wav/4704.wav|EN-US|EN| He should resign.
10k/wav/4711.wav|EN-US|EN| We are the waitcust link.
10k/wav/4719.wav|EN-US|EN| Ostok sauce are provided a best.
10k/wav/4721.wav|EN-US|EN| Or is it?
10k/wav/4737.wav|EN-US|EN| Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
10k/wav/4748.wav|EN-US|EN| Then it will come.
10k/wav/4762.wav|EN-US|EN| About the bad things that happened to me.
10k/wav/4763.wav|EN-US|EN| But we were wrong.
10k/wav/4764.wav|EN-US|EN| We are in the business of selling tickets.
10k/wav/4794.wav|EN-US|EN| Analysts had a mixture action to the numbers.
10k/wav/4802.wav|EN-US|EN| That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
10k/wav/4810.wav|EN-US|EN| It's easy to see why.
10k/wav/4813.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
10k/wav/4814.wav|EN-US|EN| Wilson will tell the truth.
10k/wav/4819.wav|EN-US|EN| You've just got to move on.
10k/wav/4823.wav|EN-US|EN| A further police inquiry is going to be held.
10k/wav/4855.wav|EN-US|EN| That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
10k/wav/4865.wav|EN-US|EN| Secondly, there are other options for patients.
10k/wav/4867.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not conducting the review.
10k/wav/4878.wav|EN-US|EN| This is actually true.
10k/wav/4886.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a decision which has paid off.
10k/wav/4892.wav|EN-US|EN| The campaign ran in Lothian, Fife and central Scotland police areas.
10k/wav/4894.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the last thing it would be.
10k/wav/4895.wav|EN-US|EN| But every two minutes it was exploding.
10k/wav/4902.wav|EN-US|EN| At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
10k/wav/4909.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been recorded twice.
10k/wav/4950.wav|EN-US|EN| After that, it's never the same again.
10k/wav/4960.wav|EN-US|EN| Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
10k/wav/4962.wav|EN-US|EN| They need to look after themselves.
10k/wav/4965.wav|EN-US|EN| That question was never asked.
10k/wav/4991.wav|EN-US|EN| That is where our future lies.
10k/wav/4997.wav|EN-US|EN| It all happened so suddenly.
10k/wav/5002.wav|EN-US|EN| They seem to be backing off from that.
10k/wav/5014.wav|EN-US|EN| Domestical piece is related to power and control.
10k/wav/5025.wav|EN-US|EN| They had given up on him.
10k/wav/5038.wav|EN-US|EN| And then a funny thing happened.
10k/wav/5039.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a serial conservative assassin.
10k/wav/5043.wav|EN-US|EN| He should be a great asset.
10k/wav/5071.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very difficult.
10k/wav/5079.wav|EN-US|EN| The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
10k/wav/5087.wav|EN-US|EN| No one expected that my parents would stay.
10k/wav/5090.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a question of perception.
10k/wav/510.wav|EN-US|EN| The boss can speak about little hours.
10k/wav/5105.wav|EN-US|EN| He did not say that.
10k/wav/5107.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an accounting no.
10k/wav/5109.wav|EN-US|EN| I get very excited by that.
10k/wav/5119.wav|EN-US|EN| It involved the same people.
10k/wav/5123.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the greatest moment of our lives.
10k/wav/5130.wav|EN-US|EN| The reason is partly because of tradition.
10k/wav/5132.wav|EN-US|EN| We work for the athlete.
10k/wav/5154.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very demanding course.
10k/wav/5161.wav|EN-US|EN| He was in a great deal of pain.
10k/wav/5175.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
10k/wav/519.wav|EN-US|EN| Seven people were already in custody in France.
10k/wav/5208.wav|EN-US|EN| We did not compete with any other local farmer.
10k/wav/521.wav|EN-US|EN| They have done nothing of the sort.
10k/wav/522.wav|EN-US|EN| Parents should avoid it.
10k/wav/5226.wav|EN-US|EN| Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
10k/wav/5227.wav|EN-US|EN| That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
10k/wav/5254.wav|EN-US|EN| He needs to be.
10k/wav/5286.wav|EN-US|EN| The ministers are not to make their decision.
10k/wav/530.wav|EN-US|EN| Because it's a secret.
10k/wav/5315.wav|EN-US|EN| There was nothing she could do.
10k/wav/5326.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot believe it's so calm.
10k/wav/5329.wav|EN-US|EN| The answer was up there on this stage.
10k/wav/5335.wav|EN-US|EN| It was little else.
10k/wav/5344.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't feel good.
10k/wav/5352.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't mean in a frightening way.
10k/wav/536.wav|EN-US|EN| I will never change your policy on paying the parents money.
10k/wav/5360.wav|EN-US|EN| It needs somebody to give away.
10k/wav/5370.wav|EN-US|EN| It is on the internet.
10k/wav/5379.wav|EN-US|EN| I think this proposal is excellent.
10k/wav/5380.wav|EN-US|EN| The response from everyone was wonderful.
10k/wav/5386.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't know what he was capable of.
10k/wav/5392.wav|EN-US|EN| He also has a house in Italy.
10k/wav/5399.wav|EN-US|EN| Ferguson had done his homework.
10k/wav/5417.wav|EN-US|EN| The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods pass from earth to the home in the skies.
10k/wav/5426.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to have some hope and faith.
10k/wav/5442.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a major step forward for cars.
10k/wav/5462.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was too late.
10k/wav/5486.wav|EN-US|EN| All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
10k/wav/5490.wav|EN-US|EN| Class guys are told to force.
10k/wav/5501.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm prepared to step down.
10k/wav/5506.wav|EN-US|EN| There's no choice is there?
10k/wav/5510.wav|EN-US|EN| Robert is a special talent.
10k/wav/5512.wav|EN-US|EN| That took two weeks.
10k/wav/5515.wav|EN-US|EN| We knew we had the gold we wanted.
10k/wav/5525.wav|EN-US|EN| Some our sympathies have left the country.
10k/wav/5527.wav|EN-US|EN| You cut the table.
10k/wav/5530.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
10k/wav/5534.wav|EN-US|EN| Others are expected to do so soon.
10k/wav/5578.wav|EN-US|EN| It is important that vital services are maintained.
10k/wav/5615.wav|EN-US|EN| While the children on the roll are genuine.
10k/wav/5616.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
10k/wav/5643.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a water rail home.
10k/wav/5646.wav|EN-US|EN| You know the sort of thing.
10k/wav/5648.wav|EN-US|EN| The commission is not their knee-loser.
10k/wav/5666.wav|EN-US|EN| She now lives in London
10k/wav/567.wav|EN-US|EN| R is very, very much a curl.
10k/wav/5689.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a success story by any standard.
10k/wav/570.wav|EN-US|EN| This is very good news.
10k/wav/5728.wav|EN-US|EN| The main concern is that it could interfere without traffic.
10k/wav/573.wav|EN-US|EN| Britain is going to celebrate in style
10k/wav/5737.wav|EN-US|EN| At the last I found a bunker.
10k/wav/5745.wav|EN-US|EN| He said it was the worst possible result.
10k/wav/5767.wav|EN-US|EN| We hope for a fresh board with the fresh, clear locut things.
10k/wav/5771.wav|EN-US|EN| The other was the tablets.
10k/wav/578.wav|EN-US|EN| There is nothing like this back home.
10k/wav/5780.wav|EN-US|EN| We should not worry about other players.
10k/wav/5782.wav|EN-US|EN| In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.
10k/wav/5783.wav|EN-US|EN| No plan for projects are yet in place.
10k/wav/5786.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, so did a couple of those.
10k/wav/5791.wav|EN-US|EN| But the relief was short-lived.
10k/wav/5799.wav|EN-US|EN| This is an internal matter
10k/wav/5803.wav|EN-US|EN| He plays a new for himself.
10k/wav/5822.wav|EN-US|EN| I always have had the company of the voice.
10k/wav/5823.wav|EN-US|EN| Lipay is endemic in the national health service.
10k/wav/5855.wav|EN-US|EN| It was important to bring them all together.
10k/wav/5864.wav|EN-US|EN| How can you not react?
10k/wav/5866.wav|EN-US|EN| He then had to swipe out hearts.
10k/wav/589.wav|EN-US|EN| He has changed the country itself.
10k/wav/591.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
10k/wav/5921.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows the contempt by him from the industry.
10k/wav/5922.wav|EN-US|EN| We are a husband and wife team.
10k/wav/5932.wav|EN-US|EN| Our focus remains on quality revenue.
10k/wav/5936.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no reason at all.
10k/wav/5954.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a question of patience.
10k/wav/5964.wav|EN-US|EN| He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
10k/wav/5970.wav|EN-US|EN| But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
10k/wav/5979.wav|EN-US|EN| The charges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
10k/wav/5982.wav|EN-US|EN| That's how it worked in Bosnia.
10k/wav/5993.wav|EN-US|EN| Their message was simple.
10k/wav/600.wav|EN-US|EN| No government has that right.
10k/wav/6001.wav|EN-US|EN| Time may already have run out for this option.
10k/wav/6004.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very safe.
10k/wav/6006.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not a fell.
10k/wav/6014.wav|EN-US|EN| I started on fire a couple of times.
10k/wav/6019.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be Anna For now.
10k/wav/6022.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody called me to explain.
10k/wav/6025.wav|EN-US|EN| Ranges are my life
10k/wav/6039.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't do it.
10k/wav/6063.wav|EN-US|EN| The police recording.
10k/wav/6079.wav|EN-US|EN| Once we have done that the tender will be put out.
10k/wav/6082.wav|EN-US|EN| What kind of person is he?
10k/wav/6085.wav|EN-US|EN| They were even being used by primary pupils.
10k/wav/6097.wav|EN-US|EN| He looks like an Afghan.
10k/wav/61.wav|EN-US|EN| Military chiefs were playing it straight.
10k/wav/6144.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the goal.
10k/wav/6157.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be a danger.
10k/wav/616.wav|EN-US|EN| It may not be lifelong.
10k/wav/6161.wav|EN-US|EN| How can they get one?
10k/wav/6169.wav|EN-US|EN| I managed to do that.
10k/wav/6175.wav|EN-US|EN| We tried to keep it right.
10k/wav/619.wav|EN-US|EN| If the director is with you.
10k/wav/6193.wav|EN-US|EN| Every case is completely different.
10k/wav/6197.wav|EN-US|EN| We have an election in it days.
10k/wav/6213.wav|EN-US|EN| It is about more than Scotland.
10k/wav/6214.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope that is the lucky break.
10k/wav/6215.wav|EN-US|EN| I could easily do that.
10k/wav/6218.wav|EN-US|EN| If they are not, the Commission will take action.
10k/wav/6236.wav|EN-US|EN| In France, the reverse is true.
10k/wav/6239.wav|EN-US|EN| They haven't got the uniform.
10k/wav/6242.wav|EN-US|EN| No one wants a dispute.
10k/wav/6249.wav|EN-US|EN| This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
10k/wav/6258.wav|EN-US|EN| If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plants.
10k/wav/6295.wav|EN-US|EN| Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods pass from earth to their home in the sky.
10k/wav/63.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a family debt.
10k/wav/6300.wav|EN-US|EN| The Scots are great.
10k/wav/6302.wav|EN-US|EN| Some of the passing was a disgrace.
10k/wav/6314.wav|EN-US|EN| Wealth is relative.
10k/wav/632.wav|EN-US|EN| So you let me know.
10k/wav/6320.wav|EN-US|EN| I can understand the frustrations of our fence.
10k/wav/6342.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly it took a tragedy to change things.
10k/wav/635.wav|EN-US|EN| The warning, it is timely.
10k/wav/6360.wav|EN-US|EN| Iron people are coming over on Friday
10k/wav/6380.wav|EN-US|EN| That's a hint of classical.
10k/wav/6383.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
10k/wav/6385.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be for the committee to decide.
10k/wav/6388.wav|EN-US|EN| As far as we were concerned, the deal with Kennedy was dead.
10k/wav/6390.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a Neo
10k/wav/6395.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a clop on the rice.
10k/wav/6401.wav|EN-US|EN| He's not a Celtic man.
10k/wav/6426.wav|EN-US|EN| No sooner have we got it than we wanted it different.
10k/wav/6428.wav|EN-US|EN| The sense of excitement installing is tangible.
10k/wav/6434.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully that will come from someone on our side.
10k/wav/6441.wav|EN-US|EN| The reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
10k/wav/6445.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly audiences are unsettled.
10k/wav/645.wav|EN-US|EN| It would take three days.
10k/wav/6457.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a tremendous amount of adventure.
10k/wav/6473.wav|EN-US|EN| We created so many chances.
10k/wav/6478.wav|EN-US|EN| You did not see it.
10k/wav/6480.wav|EN-US|EN| It is nice to be a roommate and a wife.
10k/wav/6485.wav|EN-US|EN| It remains in public ownership.
10k/wav/6487.wav|EN-US|EN| The principle is quite clear.
10k/wav/6500.wav|EN-US|EN| In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
10k/wav/6504.wav|EN-US|EN| The real art was planned for the blast.
10k/wav/6509.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there was no hope and glory to Scotland.
10k/wav/6516.wav|EN-US|EN| Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
10k/wav/6521.wav|EN-US|EN| Either way, the investor rotates the premium.
10k/wav/6523.wav|EN-US|EN| The agency is real.
10k/wav/6525.wav|EN-US|EN| By then he was walking on water.
10k/wav/6528.wav|EN-US|EN| Appointments should be made on note.
10k/wav/654.wav|EN-US|EN| It lasted longer than we thought.
10k/wav/6543.wav|EN-US|EN| Wogby is a hot came
10k/wav/6555.wav|EN-US|EN| Analysts believe the market would welcome the grapes' plan.
10k/wav/6558.wav|EN-US|EN| We always felt we could win.
10k/wav/6560.wav|EN-US|EN| The written judgment was issued in printed form.
10k/wav/6568.wav|EN-US|EN| This is just one example.
10k/wav/6593.wav|EN-US|EN| That's a pot, though, I feel good.
10k/wav/6594.wav|EN-US|EN| The thumb also has a construction division.
10k/wav/6599.wav|EN-US|EN| I knew he was good.
10k/wav/6604.wav|EN-US|EN| PN investor ready is a good start.
10k/wav/6609.wav|EN-US|EN| He said some things which were better left alone.
10k/wav/6614.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not interested in the past.
10k/wav/6617.wav|EN-US|EN| The City Council is a major property unknown in the area.
10k/wav/6621.wav|EN-US|EN| We can have no complaints.
10k/wav/6629.wav|EN-US|EN| These were the edited hides.
10k/wav/6633.wav|EN-US|EN| I love this job.
10k/wav/6639.wav|EN-US|EN| It's my initial background
10k/wav/6640.wav|EN-US|EN| It's difficult to put a date on.
10k/wav/6642.wav|EN-US|EN| You hope he prevails.
10k/wav/6651.wav|EN-US|EN| It is also central to the unfolding drama.
10k/wav/6670.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't see any reason not to die.
10k/wav/6676.wav|EN-US|EN| Some changes have been achieved at great cost.
10k/wav/6691.wav|EN-US|EN| The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
10k/wav/6696.wav|EN-US|EN| He highlighted a lack of stuff.
10k/wav/6703.wav|EN-US|EN| Our objective is to tackle poverty.
10k/wav/6723.wav|EN-US|EN| Would you take them?
10k/wav/6745.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
10k/wav/6763.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it is a release of tension.
10k/wav/6766.wav|EN-US|EN| He explained to his audience.
10k/wav/6771.wav|EN-US|EN| It is hard to tell.
10k/wav/6779.wav|EN-US|EN| That shows the impact it had.
10k/wav/6783.wav|EN-US|EN| She had kept the niece from him.
10k/wav/6789.wav|EN-US|EN| Why has it taken so long?
10k/wav/6792.wav|EN-US|EN| Don't you think it was a fun performance?
10k/wav/6806.wav|EN-US|EN| A decision is expected shortly.
10k/wav/684.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to be able to play the game.
10k/wav/6845.wav|EN-US|EN| When you think you cannot go on, you can.
10k/wav/6849.wav|EN-US|EN| We were on our way.
10k/wav/6851.wav|EN-US|EN| You are like an animal.
10k/wav/6858.wav|EN-US|EN| I select in a different way.
10k/wav/6874.wav|EN-US|EN| A neighbor said the street was shocked.
10k/wav/6875.wav|EN-US|EN| Lord McDonald has worked on this deal for three months.
10k/wav/688.wav|EN-US|EN| We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
10k/wav/6884.wav|EN-US|EN| Further management changes are planned.
10k/wav/6908.wav|EN-US|EN| And you would argue with that?
10k/wav/6909.wav|EN-US|EN| Trink and petrol prices remain untouched.
10k/wav/6919.wav|EN-US|EN| They are looking at flotation
10k/wav/6939.wav|EN-US|EN| And he is not alone.
10k/wav/6971.wav|EN-US|EN| They are a good team.
10k/wav/6972.wav|EN-US|EN| It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
10k/wav/6988.wav|EN-US|EN| They have shown a great desire and attitude.
10k/wav/6992.wav|EN-US|EN| He was right into football from Vanillage.
10k/wav/70.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel sorry for the rats.
10k/wav/7008.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel so desperately sorry for Cordon on Sarah.
10k/wav/7014.wav|EN-US|EN| I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
10k/wav/7024.wav|EN-US|EN| You've been a great audience.
10k/wav/7036.wav|EN-US|EN| They thought they had found a home.
10k/wav/7041.wav|EN-US|EN| Who do you think will win?
10k/wav/7044.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not about the money, it is about everything.
10k/wav/7045.wav|EN-US|EN| The criminal justice system does not do that.
10k/wav/7054.wav|EN-US|EN| We are a vitamin.
10k/wav/7056.wav|EN-US|EN| It is inherent in society.
10k/wav/7058.wav|EN-US|EN| I was just happy to get my own goal.
10k/wav/706.wav|EN-US|EN| It is normal for me.
10k/wav/707.wav|EN-US|EN| It would have to be.
10k/wav/7087.wav|EN-US|EN| Let us hope it's an investment in the future.
10k/wav/7089.wav|EN-US|EN| Sandy was very active.
10k/wav/7091.wav|EN-US|EN| Their understanding entirely deserve their win.
10k/wav/7097.wav|EN-US|EN| I've had six days of rehearsal.
10k/wav/7099.wav|EN-US|EN| Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
10k/wav/7120.wav|EN-US|EN| I think in three dimensions.
10k/wav/7124.wav|EN-US|EN| Night has doubled in size.
10k/wav/7128.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no point of looking any further.
10k/wav/7138.wav|EN-US|EN| We are so, so lucky so many people have died.
10k/wav/7149.wav|EN-US|EN| It's about taking risks.
10k/wav/7156.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a long term discussion paper.
10k/wav/7177.wav|EN-US|EN| acts of listening to these people.
10k/wav/720.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't mean that much.
10k/wav/7204.wav|EN-US|EN| Callo was at the core of his life.
10k/wav/7208.wav|EN-US|EN| It needs a rethink.
10k/wav/7216.wav|EN-US|EN| That's why he plays for Scotland.
10k/wav/7220.wav|EN-US|EN| The proposals were never taken seriously.
10k/wav/7237.wav|EN-US|EN| So was the first half.
10k/wav/7245.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to go for it.
10k/wav/7251.wav|EN-US|EN| an imitally impressive recording it is too
10k/wav/7252.wav|EN-US|EN| Apart from that they would not be making any comment.
10k/wav/7269.wav|EN-US|EN| We've become no plants with regard to recording, but who knows?
10k/wav/727.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very hot for her.
10k/wav/7270.wav|EN-US|EN| When he took over it really took off.
10k/wav/7285.wav|EN-US|EN| That was enough for the committee.
10k/wav/7304.wav|EN-US|EN| I just carry on with Mark.
10k/wav/7305.wav|EN-US|EN| This is wrong, but that's believed.
10k/wav/7311.wav|EN-US|EN| It appears to have been successful.
10k/wav/7324.wav|EN-US|EN| This has been very frustrating for him
10k/wav/7327.wav|EN-US|EN| The band was good and it's been a great day.
10k/wav/7345.wav|EN-US|EN| they will be dealt with.
10k/wav/7356.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a terrible combination of factors.
10k/wav/7358.wav|EN-US|EN| They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
10k/wav/7359.wav|EN-US|EN| It's about the balance.
10k/wav/7382.wav|EN-US|EN| But who gets on the tubo?
10k/wav/7396.wav|EN-US|EN| It was visibly on fire.
10k/wav/7398.wav|EN-US|EN| He was extremely nervous.
10k/wav/7417.wav|EN-US|EN| It should have a health warning. It is addictive.
10k/wav/7420.wav|EN-US|EN| Robin Williams is very substitute.
10k/wav/7425.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't find any danger from them.
10k/wav/7452.wav|EN-US|EN| Art can challenge our values system.
10k/wav/746.wav|EN-US|EN| In no event, it was to be the latter.
10k/wav/7460.wav|EN-US|EN| I was the trial judge in this
10k/wav/7469.wav|EN-US|EN| Andrew McClellan is no exception.
10k/wav/7473.wav|EN-US|EN| It is truly fields of miracles.
10k/wav/7483.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been doing it for years.
10k/wav/7484.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all changed in Killmonic.
10k/wav/7498.wav|EN-US|EN| Dennis was not so sure.
10k/wav/7502.wav|EN-US|EN| Finally, we decided to put the Hells Beach in.
10k/wav/7510.wav|EN-US|EN| But it would say that
10k/wav/7540.wav|EN-US|EN| If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
10k/wav/7549.wav|EN-US|EN| That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
10k/wav/7561.wav|EN-US|EN| We just have to improve.
10k/wav/7564.wav|EN-US|EN| They have failed to explode
10k/wav/7567.wav|EN-US|EN| It's here they cut them down a bit.
10k/wav/7573.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel privileged to be here.
10k/wav/758.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be two other areas of contention.
10k/wav/7583.wav|EN-US|EN| I need him well.
10k/wav/7588.wav|EN-US|EN| Cordon is also thoroughly rated.
10k/wav/7595.wav|EN-US|EN| The process itself has taken over.
10k/wav/7603.wav|EN-US|EN| I loved it and so did my friend.
10k/wav/7605.wav|EN-US|EN| That is how the footman is feeling today.
10k/wav/7606.wav|EN-US|EN| It could claim a public interest.
10k/wav/7615.wav|EN-US|EN| It happened so quickly.
10k/wav/7623.wav|EN-US|EN| However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
10k/wav/7627.wav|EN-US|EN| I was better prepared than a Yogi.
10k/wav/7633.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, it won't.
10k/wav/7636.wav|EN-US|EN| They were very unfair to him.
10k/wav/7643.wav|EN-US|EN| They've got to get better.
10k/wav/7644.wav|EN-US|EN| I like what has happened.
10k/wav/7650.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be judged by his actions.
10k/wav/7696.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that possible?
10k/wav/770.wav|EN-US|EN| He is advised that he is Denso.
10k/wav/7710.wav|EN-US|EN| A decision is expected next March.
10k/wav/7712.wav|EN-US|EN| Otherwise we will pay the price.
10k/wav/7715.wav|EN-US|EN| But she was...
10k/wav/7731.wav|EN-US|EN| The poured meetings will be held in Edinburgh.
10k/wav/7751.wav|EN-US|EN| Well done that, it's the vicious circle.
10k/wav/7765.wav|EN-US|EN| His employees say the same about him.
10k/wav/7766.wav|EN-US|EN| I've tried to get on with math.
10k/wav/7776.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought they could have made the gesture.
10k/wav/7780.wav|EN-US|EN| Home is in the Scottish Borders.
10k/wav/7788.wav|EN-US|EN| Something is wrong.
10k/wav/78.wav|EN-US|EN| But this is different.
10k/wav/7805.wav|EN-US|EN| This club have been fair to me.
10k/wav/7819.wav|EN-US|EN| It is premature to speculate on the impact.
10k/wav/7831.wav|EN-US|EN| We should recognise that others have done a good job.
10k/wav/7834.wav|EN-US|EN| How do you get it back?
10k/wav/7843.wav|EN-US|EN| Potato was only a matter of time.
10k/wav/7847.wav|EN-US|EN| However, she is female, and so...
10k/wav/7851.wav|EN-US|EN| In due course we will make an announcement.
10k/wav/7862.wav|EN-US|EN| That's when you hope to take advantage.
10k/wav/7880.wav|EN-US|EN| It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
10k/wav/7881.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a good result for them.
10k/wav/7885.wav|EN-US|EN| A venue was found.
10k/wav/7886.wav|EN-US|EN| It's up to them to decide.
10k/wav/789.wav|EN-US|EN| His instructions were clear.
10k/wav/7896.wav|EN-US|EN| He has written to the minister after meetings on the Ound.
10k/wav/7903.wav|EN-US|EN| But we have come under attack.
10k/wav/7915.wav|EN-US|EN| For many, it had become a fact of life.
10k/wav/7942.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland won by six wickets.
10k/wav/7954.wav|EN-US|EN| Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
10k/wav/7967.wav|EN-US|EN| They take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
10k/wav/7969.wav|EN-US|EN| Mandu, war was not lost.
10k/wav/7973.wav|EN-US|EN| But this one has a lot of potential.
10k/wav/8020.wav|EN-US|EN| I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
10k/wav/8028.wav|EN-US|EN| She failed in action.
10k/wav/8034.wav|EN-US|EN| It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
10k/wav/8047.wav|EN-US|EN| The rest was badminton.
10k/wav/805.wav|EN-US|EN| But we can have a casino.
10k/wav/8052.wav|EN-US|EN| or TV.
10k/wav/8053.wav|EN-US|EN| thought to get my sunglasses
10k/wav/8054.wav|EN-US|EN| The website has changed the company.
10k/wav/8058.wav|EN-US|EN| But it was a loss.
10k/wav/806.wav|EN-US|EN| We don't believe anything anymore.
10k/wav/8062.wav|EN-US|EN| We have seen the future and it is different.
10k/wav/8071.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Bled was in Washington a week later.
10k/wav/8077.wav|EN-US|EN| Plot samples have been taken.
10k/wav/808.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
10k/wav/8085.wav|EN-US|EN| The stage was set for a showdown.
10k/wav/8111.wav|EN-US|EN| I am desperate to play in this much.
10k/wav/8120.wav|EN-US|EN| Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
10k/wav/8125.wav|EN-US|EN| He is helping police with their enquiries.
10k/wav/8126.wav|EN-US|EN| The Royal Parliament was no exception.
10k/wav/813.wav|EN-US|EN| I just know it's a lot.
10k/wav/8131.wav|EN-US|EN| I was waiting for that question.
10k/wav/8152.wav|EN-US|EN| But both were involved with other matters.
10k/wav/8190.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully the whole Scottish rugby was paying attention.
10k/wav/8195.wav|EN-US|EN| But in the end he did employ them away.
10k/wav/8204.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
10k/wav/8210.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not seeking the right to strike.
10k/wav/8222.wav|EN-US|EN| Another mindset, it was horrible.
10k/wav/8228.wav|EN-US|EN| England against France is always a big game.
10k/wav/8240.wav|EN-US|EN| But dependents were quick to criticise.
10k/wav/8243.wav|EN-US|EN| It was really frustrating.
10k/wav/8248.wav|EN-US|EN| My love is a mess.
10k/wav/8262.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't have a tree.
10k/wav/8273.wav|EN-US|EN| This is excellent news for the workforce.
10k/wav/8297.wav|EN-US|EN| I will miss him.
10k/wav/8302.wav|EN-US|EN| The election is total confusion and chaos.
10k/wav/8319.wav|EN-US|EN| No plans for projects are yet in place.
10k/wav/8330.wav|EN-US|EN| They will not be going back.
10k/wav/8344.wav|EN-US|EN| The new work will begin in the autumn.
10k/wav/8345.wav|EN-US|EN| This was never a support group.
10k/wav/8346.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be patient, but we will win.
10k/wav/8360.wav|EN-US|EN| The hell team was rubbish.
10k/wav/8365.wav|EN-US|EN| They thought he was asking the right questions.
10k/wav/8366.wav|EN-US|EN| Famer and money forward
10k/wav/8398.wav|EN-US|EN| It was nice to get a clean sheet.
10k/wav/8399.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he never saw it.
10k/wav/8433.wav|EN-US|EN| It's our worst nightmare.
10k/wav/8434.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone who is very sad
10k/wav/8436.wav|EN-US|EN| We're very delighted about the vit.
10k/wav/8447.wav|EN-US|EN| Police have appealed for witnesses.
10k/wav/8465.wav|EN-US|EN| That, however, is only part of the story.
10k/wav/8469.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that a serious question?
10k/wav/849.wav|EN-US|EN| Other people had looked at it.
10k/wav/85.wav|EN-US|EN| She became a heroine of my childhood.
10k/wav/8507.wav|EN-US|EN| We tried to get them down.
10k/wav/8516.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be tough opponents to this report.
10k/wav/8520.wav|EN-US|EN| The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
10k/wav/8523.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't think we deserved to get...
10k/wav/8527.wav|EN-US|EN| Cars are great for going long distances.
10k/wav/8537.wav|EN-US|EN| Thankfully we have started to listen to our customers.
10k/wav/8543.wav|EN-US|EN| The child has denied murder.
10k/wav/8548.wav|EN-US|EN| Is it a fright to you men?
10k/wav/8560.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no mandate for a regime change.
10k/wav/8566.wav|EN-US|EN| I made a mistake.
10k/wav/8582.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a large number.
10k/wav/8585.wav|EN-US|EN| We backed away from writing the source.
10k/wav/8586.wav|EN-US|EN| So here's the Pinto ideas.
10k/wav/8599.wav|EN-US|EN| The report is to you next month.
10k/wav/8611.wav|EN-US|EN| It is now down in black and white.
10k/wav/8615.wav|EN-US|EN| Wars was in at the teapent.
10k/wav/8623.wav|EN-US|EN| It was almost too much.
10k/wav/8624.wav|EN-US|EN| Like many companies it is a problem.
10k/wav/8629.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm the opposite because I haven't played very much.
10k/wav/8639.wav|EN-US|EN| What will happen then?
10k/wav/8650.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not time for justice.
10k/wav/8659.wav|EN-US|EN| It rins until the beginning of June.
10k/wav/8677.wav|EN-US|EN| and the remit is limited.
10k/wav/8681.wav|EN-US|EN| I had a tie in my hand.
10k/wav/8693.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither had any other crew.
10k/wav/871.wav|EN-US|EN| Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
10k/wav/8715.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not defeated.
10k/wav/8729.wav|EN-US|EN| He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
10k/wav/8748.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's hope that it does.
10k/wav/8766.wav|EN-US|EN| My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
10k/wav/8773.wav|EN-US|EN| In short, the club was broke.
10k/wav/8796.wav|EN-US|EN| It left me with sadness.
10k/wav/8806.wav|EN-US|EN| The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
10k/wav/8822.wav|EN-US|EN| His remarks appear to have had an effect.
10k/wav/8823.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not sure he does.
10k/wav/8828.wav|EN-US|EN| Both men were on one gear contracts.
10k/wav/883.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm ready for that.
10k/wav/8830.wav|EN-US|EN| The pound has also suffered.
10k/wav/8833.wav|EN-US|EN| I can give no comment
10k/wav/8839.wav|EN-US|EN| These things just happen.
10k/wav/8853.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope the couples are still together.
10k/wav/8858.wav|EN-US|EN| It's nice to be involved.
10k/wav/8859.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, it was Jeffrey Robinson.
10k/wav/8863.wav|EN-US|EN| But someone has got to do it.
10k/wav/8866.wav|EN-US|EN| But one children to go by that.
10k/wav/8869.wav|EN-US|EN| Even then this game was not over.
10k/wav/8872.wav|EN-US|EN| It is likely the rest of the market will false it.
10k/wav/890.wav|EN-US|EN| It is linked to the rail over proposed changes at Scottish Palais.
10k/wav/8920.wav|EN-US|EN| Mystics are being made on an increasing basis.
10k/wav/8923.wav|EN-US|EN| It also condemned the suicide bombers.
10k/wav/8928.wav|EN-US|EN| He added that her comments were noted.
10k/wav/893.wav|EN-US|EN| I found a fort and worked at it.
10k/wav/8942.wav|EN-US|EN| You cannot allow it to go on.
10k/wav/8958.wav|EN-US|EN| We are in the hut.
10k/wav/8967.wav|EN-US|EN| Why ambition is to tell a good story.
10k/wav/898.wav|EN-US|EN| The Medi has denied any cover-up.
10k/wav/8980.wav|EN-US|EN| Measure would be entirely logical.
10k/wav/8982.wav|EN-US|EN| I so proud to be Scottish tonight.
10k/wav/8986.wav|EN-US|EN| He sets the nature of this Parliament in simple and realistic context.
10k/wav/9000.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the logical extension of audio description.
10k/wav/9001.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a birthday party.
10k/wav/9009.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been over before.
10k/wav/9027.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the fairy anyway.
10k/wav/9032.wav|EN-US|EN| Boy is the town a mess.
10k/wav/9035.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything depends on the weather.
10k/wav/9059.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the same old story.
10k/wav/9062.wav|EN-US|EN| There are known people, Hannah.
10k/wav/9078.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not a magician.
10k/wav/9085.wav|EN-US|EN| Since then, physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10k/wav/909.wav|EN-US|EN| We still have a long long way to go
10k/wav/9092.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm looking at ways to do that now.
10k/wav/9106.wav|EN-US|EN| I was a lucky man to net.
10k/wav/911.wav|EN-US|EN| to what you have to do.
10k/wav/9110.wav|EN-US|EN| The fans would love it.
10k/wav/9111.wav|EN-US|EN| It was good.
10k/wav/914.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not doing the Today programme.
10k/wav/9142.wav|EN-US|EN| That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
10k/wav/9149.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a great potential on this river.
10k/wav/9157.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm pretty happy with the wire plate.
10k/wav/9163.wav|EN-US|EN| They have a car and cannot afford another.
10k/wav/9170.wav|EN-US|EN| His film is not.
10k/wav/9190.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not going to be complacent.
10k/wav/9191.wav|EN-US|EN| He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
10k/wav/9194.wav|EN-US|EN| The hell thing was filmed in Hollywood.
10k/wav/9218.wav|EN-US|EN| They have no history.
10k/wav/923.wav|EN-US|EN| Kolf has lost a great character.
10k/wav/9234.wav|EN-US|EN| It wouldn't matter if he had.
10k/wav/9244.wav|EN-US|EN| It was exactly four months away.
10k/wav/9257.wav|EN-US|EN| We just tried to make great records.
10k/wav/9261.wav|EN-US|EN| or repaint by the taxpayer.
10k/wav/927.wav|EN-US|EN| Some young girls also came by last night.
10k/wav/9273.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't believe the bus.
10k/wav/9294.wav|EN-US|EN| I was dead.
10k/wav/9295.wav|EN-US|EN| Brian was last to join.
10k/wav/9302.wav|EN-US|EN| It's for that reason he should resign.
10k/wav/9310.wav|EN-US|EN| It was never a starter.
10k/wav/9315.wav|EN-US|EN| H's can be expected.
10k/wav/9349.wav|EN-US|EN| He was not alone.
10k/wav/9357.wav|EN-US|EN| Before the came we went for a pint.
10k/wav/9362.wav|EN-US|EN| I bought a Corot auction.
10k/wav/9369.wav|EN-US|EN| His behaviour today has been disgusting.
10k/wav/937.wav|EN-US|EN| We're only taking on a couple just now.
10k/wav/9385.wav|EN-US|EN| So we will catch their numbers.
10k/wav/9389.wav|EN-US|EN| We just want the session to end.
10k/wav/9390.wav|EN-US|EN| We believe that the reason is poverty.
10k/wav/9393.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to have a hell of an effect.
10k/wav/9399.wav|EN-US|EN| I do not wage about the critics.
10k/wav/9402.wav|EN-US|EN| It succeeds in eject and convincing manner.
10k/wav/9416.wav|EN-US|EN| They promised to fight the plans.
10k/wav/9427.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course he was right.
10k/wav/9432.wav|EN-US|EN| The attack was totally out of the blue.
10k/wav/9433.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a vacuum.
10k/wav/9439.wav|EN-US|EN| Thankfully Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
10k/wav/9441.wav|EN-US|EN| Wither stores or public property.
10k/wav/9448.wav|EN-US|EN| He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
10k/wav/9468.wav|EN-US|EN| It was total confusion.
10k/wav/9481.wav|EN-US|EN| It's funny how it comes and goes.
10k/wav/9485.wav|EN-US|EN| Subnot used with Kuntzy.
10k/wav/9486.wav|EN-US|EN| Police are appearing for witnesses.
10k/wav/950.wav|EN-US|EN| The party lasted all night.
10k/wav/9521.wav|EN-US|EN| They don't detect you to mass graves.
10k/wav/9524.wav|EN-US|EN| The success story shows no signs of stopping.
10k/wav/9549.wav|EN-US|EN| We deserve the draw.
10k/wav/9560.wav|EN-US|EN| They were kept there for a summer.
10k/wav/9569.wav|EN-US|EN| It's probably just as well.
10k/wav/957.wav|EN-US|EN| It was complete nonsense.
10k/wav/9584.wav|EN-US|EN| Prime Minister Blair is not that way.
10k/wav/9588.wav|EN-US|EN| For show we want to win it.
10k/wav/9589.wav|EN-US|EN| But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
10k/wav/9607.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole thing would be perfect.
10k/wav/9619.wav|EN-US|EN| There is indeed a seriousness of other businesses.
10k/wav/9648.wav|EN-US|EN| I really don't understand what is happening.
10k/wav/9652.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel as if I can hold everything there.
10k/wav/9668.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just a tax on employment.
10k/wav/9669.wav|EN-US|EN| They were going to open in early summer.
10k/wav/967.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland were beaten again.
10k/wav/9684.wav|EN-US|EN| injury has played a part but not a big one
10k/wav/9686.wav|EN-US|EN| Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
10k/wav/9690.wav|EN-US|EN| It separates the man from the base.
10k/wav/9696.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not go looking anywhere else.
10k/wav/9700.wav|EN-US|EN| So what is their secret?
10k/wav/9712.wav|EN-US|EN| That, though, is an old story
10k/wav/9714.wav|EN-US|EN| Openness is always the best way.
10k/wav/9735.wav|EN-US|EN| I was completely knackered
10k/wav/9737.wav|EN-US|EN| It worked well in Monica.
10k/wav/9741.wav|EN-US|EN| Yet what is supposed to be said?
10k/wav/9748.wav|EN-US|EN| The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours.
10k/wav/9752.wav|EN-US|EN| Either way, it's very funny
10k/wav/9753.wav|EN-US|EN| Stuart was the love and soul of the party.
10k/wav/9776.wav|EN-US|EN| If you can work, you should work
10k/wav/9785.wav|EN-US|EN| The need for an anion resolution will be put on hold.
10k/wav/9786.wav|EN-US|EN| And that match was played in June.
10k/wav/9791.wav|EN-US|EN| It should have its own network.
10k/wav/980.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no excuse.
10k/wav/9809.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't have long to wait.
10k/wav/9833.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not the case this time.
10k/wav/9842.wav|EN-US|EN| No one would believe him.
10k/wav/9885.wav|EN-US|EN| They have a further report to make in March.
10k/wav/9888.wav|EN-US|EN| In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his promo task.
10k/wav/9890.wav|EN-US|EN| This advice was accepted by ministers.
10k/wav/9891.wav|EN-US|EN| Can you believe it?
10k/wav/9895.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't think she could do that.
10k/wav/9897.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a changing of the God.
10k/wav/9899.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm really proud of my own players.
10k/wav/990.wav|EN-US|EN| But what did it matter?
10k/wav/9901.wav|EN-US|EN| There is nothing like a fresh start.
10k/wav/9937.wav|EN-US|EN| People will ask about us.
10k/wav/9957.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no future in rock music.
10k/wav/9966.wav|EN-US|EN| She wondered why we weren't trusted.
10k/wav/9975.wav|EN-US|EN| I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
10k/wav/9977.wav|EN-US|EN| You are in power.
10k/wav/9983.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm the leader.
10k/wav/9984.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought he was my friend.
10k/wav/9987.wav|EN-US|EN| It was our time maybe.
10k/wav/0.wav|EN-US|EN| We've been not getting involved.
10k/wav/1005.wav|EN-US|EN| There is enormous interest in Scotland the brand.
10k/wav/1007.wav|EN-US|EN| The pensioners did not want to know.
10k/wav/1013.wav|EN-US|EN| My husband was fighting for his life.
10k/wav/1015.wav|EN-US|EN| This seems like a very good idea.
10k/wav/1025.wav|EN-US|EN| Three days later he was killed.
10k/wav/1029.wav|EN-US|EN| This is our way to make our plant
10k/wav/1038.wav|EN-US|EN| I would say the risk is very small.
10k/wav/1040.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a world of difference.
10k/wav/1051.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a question of Islam.
10k/wav/1057.wav|EN-US|EN| They have previously been on five day notice.
10k/wav/1079.wav|EN-US|EN| Frankly it was worth the booking.
10k/wav/1094.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the type of man he was.
10k/wav/1108.wav|EN-US|EN| But that is not an issue from there.
10k/wav/1137.wav|EN-US|EN| Many many people don't know who he is.
10k/wav/1152.wav|EN-US|EN| In the end, it will mean an awful lot
10k/wav/117.wav|EN-US|EN| LAPAR is providing none of these.
10k/wav/118.wav|EN-US|EN| He's had a lot of injury problems.
10k/wav/119.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt under a lot of pressure.
10k/wav/1190.wav|EN-US|EN| It will take some time to establish.
10k/wav/1202.wav|EN-US|EN| But then the problems began.
10k/wav/1225.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm looking forward to the next two weeks.
10k/wav/123.wav|EN-US|EN| They have put in a lot of time and effort.
10k/wav/1232.wav|EN-US|EN| I love the moment of being fast.
10k/wav/1237.wav|EN-US|EN| I will make that point tonight.
10k/wav/1241.wav|EN-US|EN| went on serve
10k/wav/1244.wav|EN-US|EN| Walsan is clearly the form player just now.
10k/wav/1256.wav|EN-US|EN| A rexula bus service ends between the hall and the town centre.
10k/wav/1260.wav|EN-US|EN| We opened up and everything was gone.
10k/wav/1286.wav|EN-US|EN| Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
10k/wav/1299.wav|EN-US|EN| We have got away with it.
10k/wav/132.wav|EN-US|EN| He was visited by Kotsuo officials.
10k/wav/1338.wav|EN-US|EN| She will also go to Paris.
10k/wav/1342.wav|EN-US|EN| However, what is this callwood brew?
10k/wav/1347.wav|EN-US|EN| And so was a photograph.
10k/wav/1351.wav|EN-US|EN| You are going to go to jail
10k/wav/1355.wav|EN-US|EN| He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.
10k/wav/1364.wav|EN-US|EN| I try to be clear in the note of...
10k/wav/1366.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not defeated.
10k/wav/1378.wav|EN-US|EN| They still have the dirty work to do.
10k/wav/1380.wav|EN-US|EN| However the approach is not believed to be hostile.
10k/wav/1390.wav|EN-US|EN| They might well be right.
10k/wav/1424.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the taking port that counts.
10k/wav/1432.wav|EN-US|EN| Class gets far from Overlet
10k/wav/1439.wav|EN-US|EN| His days are long gone.
10k/wav/146.wav|EN-US|EN| That the music is truly, truly, truly great
10k/wav/1470.wav|EN-US|EN| That took a long time to happen.
10k/wav/1476.wav|EN-US|EN| Mile is very high despite the growing risks.
10k/wav/1479.wav|EN-US|EN| We thank England for the time being.
10k/wav/1481.wav|EN-US|EN| Then they scored two goals to win.
10k/wav/1489.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not either national standards or local control.
10k/wav/1497.wav|EN-US|EN| This game was no great surprise to anyone.
10k/wav/1510.wav|EN-US|EN| which, in effect, it is.
10k/wav/1516.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
10k/wav/1544.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't miss the big house at all.
10k/wav/1560.wav|EN-US|EN| They haven't to run away.
10k/wav/1569.wav|EN-US|EN| This must be really short of ideas.
10k/wav/1585.wav|EN-US|EN| She has never been back.
10k/wav/1586.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland is losing business.
10k/wav/1587.wav|EN-US|EN| We have repelled and reformed.
10k/wav/1593.wav|EN-US|EN| That has given me great confidence.
10k/wav/1605.wav|EN-US|EN| I have played well the past two days.
10k/wav/1607.wav|EN-US|EN| They have known to hold times.
10k/wav/1608.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a performance.
10k/wav/1620.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
10k/wav/1629.wav|EN-US|EN| I would love to think that she could win.
10k/wav/163.wav|EN-US|EN| They begot to decide to do that.
10k/wav/1639.wav|EN-US|EN| We will likely look for new investors.
10k/wav/1646.wav|EN-US|EN| You are always aware of the injury potential.
10k/wav/1648.wav|EN-US|EN| Our relationship has been very good.
10k/wav/1660.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a court case.
10k/wav/1666.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel I did not have enough time.
10k/wav/167.wav|EN-US|EN| He added that he felt on demand.
10k/wav/1674.wav|EN-US|EN| He has seen the past.
10k/wav/1676.wav|EN-US|EN| They will now have to justify their position.
10k/wav/1679.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a delight on every level.
10k/wav/168.wav|EN-US|EN| It runs in cycles.
10k/wav/1699.wav|EN-US|EN| They took a risk.
10k/wav/1706.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot blame the fans
10k/wav/1726.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd never run for them.
10k/wav/1730.wav|EN-US|EN| So it's the daily struggle.
10k/wav/1753.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it's not all bad news for women.
10k/wav/1760.wav|EN-US|EN| Our experience is certainly limited.
10k/wav/1766.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no problems with the crats.
10k/wav/1772.wav|EN-US|EN| Suddenly, the rugby world unchanged.
10k/wav/1773.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no guarantee.
10k/wav/1774.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd rather be singing Vadi.
10k/wav/1778.wav|EN-US|EN| Mrs. Thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
10k/wav/1785.wav|EN-US|EN| We've been talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
10k/wav/1807.wav|EN-US|EN| The change was not instant.
10k/wav/1813.wav|EN-US|EN| The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
10k/wav/1836.wav|EN-US|EN| Pre will be just one of them.
10k/wav/1851.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm so lucky for that.
10k/wav/1856.wav|EN-US|EN| There is an ongoing problem with this company.
10k/wav/1859.wav|EN-US|EN| We think a lot of our McGregor.
10k/wav/186.wav|EN-US|EN| He seems to be used to the tension.
10k/wav/1866.wav|EN-US|EN| You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
10k/wav/1875.wav|EN-US|EN| It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
10k/wav/1877.wav|EN-US|EN| There is according to the legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
10k/wav/1879.wav|EN-US|EN| Other people here are local.
10k/wav/1881.wav|EN-US|EN| He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
10k/wav/189.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a new ball game.
10k/wav/1905.wav|EN-US|EN| Further protests are likely.
10k/wav/192.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not given them the evidence.
10k/wav/194.wav|EN-US|EN| The company won the fast round but lost on appeal.
10k/wav/1949.wav|EN-US|EN| We were under a bit of pressure.
10k/wav/1960.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not just about pay.
10k/wav/1971.wav|EN-US|EN| She told me to apply for the crest.
10k/wav/1974.wav|EN-US|EN| And we can do it.
10k/wav/1975.wav|EN-US|EN| He is fully fit.
10k/wav/1985.wav|EN-US|EN| Baits and other equipment would be peeled.
10k/wav/1995.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not realistic because it's early days.
10k/wav/20.wav|EN-US|EN| I did not see any raison to change the captain.
10k/wav/2006.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lack of stuff.
10k/wav/2030.wav|EN-US|EN| The process will start tomorrow.
10k/wav/2035.wav|EN-US|EN| He also has a Scottish grandfather.
10k/wav/204.wav|EN-US|EN| He will never be forgotten.
10k/wav/2056.wav|EN-US|EN| I would have the family in the crowd.
10k/wav/2068.wav|EN-US|EN| He was due to retire in December.
10k/wav/2073.wav|EN-US|EN| I had a wonderful time working with them.
10k/wav/2089.wav|EN-US|EN| Skills to not create that.
10k/wav/2104.wav|EN-US|EN| He will decide tomorrow.
10k/wav/2106.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the real thing there.
10k/wav/2115.wav|EN-US|EN| Thompson and his family left court without comment.
10k/wav/212.wav|EN-US|EN| Will we have a play together again?
10k/wav/2123.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not just about the shows.
10k/wav/2128.wav|EN-US|EN| You never had it so good.
10k/wav/2146.wav|EN-US|EN| They had learnt from the lessons of the first game.
10k/wav/215.wav|EN-US|EN| I came as coming back.
10k/wav/2158.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
10k/wav/2168.wav|EN-US|EN| We are waiting for advice on the film.
10k/wav/2169.wav|EN-US|EN| Because we do not need it.
10k/wav/218.wav|EN-US|EN| If only it had been.
10k/wav/2191.wav|EN-US|EN| They keep the atmosphere in mind.
10k/wav/2196.wav|EN-US|EN| But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
10k/wav/2201.wav|EN-US|EN| They were worth the money.
10k/wav/2208.wav|EN-US|EN| Writing has diminished in Vali
10k/wav/2212.wav|EN-US|EN| Andan remained the faburate
10k/wav/2222.wav|EN-US|EN| He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
10k/wav/2260.wav|EN-US|EN| I was in the zone in the morning.
10k/wav/2269.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not moving then.
10k/wav/2305.wav|EN-US|EN| Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
10k/wav/2307.wav|EN-US|EN| She is really magic.
10k/wav/2319.wav|EN-US|EN| Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
10k/wav/2330.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot fit for anything else.
10k/wav/2336.wav|EN-US|EN| We were load of rubbish.
10k/wav/2340.wav|EN-US|EN| Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
10k/wav/237.wav|EN-US|EN| After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
10k/wav/2385.wav|EN-US|EN| Arsenal refused to be evicted.
10k/wav/2386.wav|EN-US|EN| Greenwood said he was happy with that.
10k/wav/2392.wav|EN-US|EN| Neither had the public.
10k/wav/2415.wav|EN-US|EN| Something has got to change.
10k/wav/2424.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got a lot of respect for the lions.
10k/wav/2434.wav|EN-US|EN| The professor is a no doubt.
10k/wav/2436.wav|EN-US|EN| There were two things going on at once.
10k/wav/2439.wav|EN-US|EN| He is delighted too with the new premises.
10k/wav/2442.wav|EN-US|EN| He was tough and relentless.
10k/wav/2471.wav|EN-US|EN| Campbell said he hoped to build on their fighting spirit against hearts.
10k/wav/2482.wav|EN-US|EN| Either way, it doesn't bother me.
10k/wav/2486.wav|EN-US|EN| or when it should be tested.
10k/wav/2489.wav|EN-US|EN| We were in Italy suddenly, Winnie.
10k/wav/2497.wav|EN-US|EN| There is support.
10k/wav/2512.wav|EN-US|EN| I got up with that in the amateur game.
10k/wav/252.wav|EN-US|EN| Weeville Dennett
10k/wav/253.wav|EN-US|EN| They could take the result away from them. Carl doesn't do they?
10k/wav/2539.wav|EN-US|EN| She wanted to move.
10k/wav/2553.wav|EN-US|EN| Many changes are positive changes.
10k/wav/2559.wav|EN-US|EN| But I'm still awaiting an answer.
10k/wav/2570.wav|EN-US|EN| A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
10k/wav/2577.wav|EN-US|EN| And only, the sorts are the key thing.
10k/wav/2581.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't to make sense.
10k/wav/2606.wav|EN-US|EN| Talks are progressing.
10k/wav/2610.wav|EN-US|EN| Someone came down on that. Can you write a script?
10k/wav/2617.wav|EN-US|EN| The actor has met with Mandela.
10k/wav/2629.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to be realistic.
10k/wav/2637.wav|EN-US|EN| I will have to work on that.
10k/wav/2653.wav|EN-US|EN| I think however, he was having the fit.
10k/wav/2662.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not happy with proposals for widgets.
10k/wav/2672.wav|EN-US|EN| We didn't want to be too intrusive.
10k/wav/2684.wav|EN-US|EN| Our people are paying high prices.
10k/wav/2686.wav|EN-US|EN| It shows the government is low-summing.
10k/wav/2693.wav|EN-US|EN| They do it properly.
10k/wav/2700.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a warm-up.
10k/wav/271.wav|EN-US|EN| We think the timing is good.
10k/wav/2718.wav|EN-US|EN| They're in this court of the half game from a penalty by Jones.
10k/wav/272.wav|EN-US|EN| As it happened, it was much more than that.
10k/wav/2720.wav|EN-US|EN| Has the conflict started?
10k/wav/2724.wav|EN-US|EN| That was about it.
10k/wav/273.wav|EN-US|EN| Lothian and Borders Peace are also involved.
10k/wav/2749.wav|EN-US|EN| How'd this been common practice?
10k/wav/2750.wav|EN-US|EN| The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
10k/wav/2752.wav|EN-US|EN| I know that from memory.
10k/wav/2759.wav|EN-US|EN| McNaughton was not so sure.
10k/wav/2760.wav|EN-US|EN| They do not let anyone into the loop.
10k/wav/2790.wav|EN-US|EN| Taxation should be simplified.
10k/wav/2792.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not only my respect for them.
10k/wav/2802.wav|EN-US|EN| He was forced to quit.
10k/wav/2808.wav|EN-US|EN| We had a rename last week.
10k/wav/281.wav|EN-US|EN| Both parties can win and Scotland can win as a result.
10k/wav/2819.wav|EN-US|EN| It is somewhere to be.
10k/wav/2823.wav|EN-US|EN| chose the medium
10k/wav/285.wav|EN-US|EN| The report on their property is due within days.
10k/wav/2851.wav|EN-US|EN| Horses are not affected.
10k/wav/2852.wav|EN-US|EN| Shondelli has a pining ambition
10k/wav/2856.wav|EN-US|EN| Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
10k/wav/2857.wav|EN-US|EN| He is obviously very dangerous.
10k/wav/2859.wav|EN-US|EN| The happiness was slightly misplaced.
10k/wav/2871.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a deeper deception.
10k/wav/2876.wav|EN-US|EN| Tomorrow night is the important game.
10k/wav/2894.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't actually woke up a speech.
10k/wav/2898.wav|EN-US|EN| I remember it clearly.
10k/wav/29.wav|EN-US|EN| They were to blame for the first two goals.
10k/wav/2908.wav|EN-US|EN| What would be the point?
10k/wav/2938.wav|EN-US|EN| I was on mine.
10k/wav/2941.wav|EN-US|EN| Our message is getting through.
10k/wav/2946.wav|EN-US|EN| Stuart will travel with some confidence.
10k/wav/295.wav|EN-US|EN| Drugs are a serious problem.
10k/wav/2952.wav|EN-US|EN| Items are surely worth a chance.
10k/wav/2984.wav|EN-US|EN| Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
10k/wav/2995.wav|EN-US|EN| It happens from time to time.
10k/wav/2999.wav|EN-US|EN| Dom Udo was passionate about his politics.
10k/wav/3022.wav|EN-US|EN| saves the rest of British sport
10k/wav/3032.wav|EN-US|EN| It was fun but not living.
10k/wav/3039.wav|EN-US|EN| His presence was very important.
10k/wav/3044.wav|EN-US|EN| I have accepted the challenge.
10k/wav/3049.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a bit of a tight trip.
10k/wav/3052.wav|EN-US|EN| The clarity is vital.
10k/wav/3060.wav|EN-US|EN| But then this caught the fourth.
10k/wav/3061.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a flexible concept.
10k/wav/3064.wav|EN-US|EN| Who's the employee?
10k/wav/3090.wav|EN-US|EN| It's always a rehearsal.
10k/wav/3105.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a good incentive for both parties to complete.
10k/wav/3116.wav|EN-US|EN| They want that school.
10k/wav/3122.wav|EN-US|EN| Who was the mystery pain?
10k/wav/3125.wav|EN-US|EN| However the second goal was about to be delivered.
10k/wav/3131.wav|EN-US|EN| And that is very good indeed.
10k/wav/3148.wav|EN-US|EN| Why it was never like this.
10k/wav/315.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we will just keep it.
10k/wav/3153.wav|EN-US|EN| Don't get me on.
10k/wav/3164.wav|EN-US|EN| It decided to blame the media.
10k/wav/3169.wav|EN-US|EN| Thankfully they liked it.
10k/wav/317.wav|EN-US|EN| It has happened and that is the end of the story.
10k/wav/3173.wav|EN-US|EN| I made my mind up before we came on tour.
10k/wav/3189.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to be very closely watched
10k/wav/3193.wav|EN-US|EN| You had better believe it.
10k/wav/3206.wav|EN-US|EN| England will be under a lot of pressure.
10k/wav/3211.wav|EN-US|EN| The service is for real.
10k/wav/3213.wav|EN-US|EN| At the moment the success in Germany is good.
10k/wav/3214.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no other way.
10k/wav/3229.wav|EN-US|EN| Who would have?
10k/wav/3262.wav|EN-US|EN| An announcement is expected this week.
10k/wav/3267.wav|EN-US|EN| This will take up to 9 months.
10k/wav/3273.wav|EN-US|EN| I just wanted a break.
10k/wav/3283.wav|EN-US|EN| It looks like a hit.
10k/wav/3286.wav|EN-US|EN| It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
10k/wav/3303.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all part of letting it go.
10k/wav/3310.wav|EN-US|EN| But I'm a white man.
10k/wav/332.wav|EN-US|EN| I would rather look at him.
10k/wav/3350.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw them not long after it happened.
10k/wav/336.wav|EN-US|EN| We believe in the medium term.
10k/wav/3360.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a close call.
10k/wav/3380.wav|EN-US|EN| That fast VIC-2 made a huge difference to microwave.
10k/wav/3383.wav|EN-US|EN| This time, there were no such rewards.
10k/wav/3395.wav|EN-US|EN| She should survive this because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
10k/wav/3401.wav|EN-US|EN| He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
10k/wav/3414.wav|EN-US|EN| They must not succeed.
10k/wav/3415.wav|EN-US|EN| The plumbing begins in 5 minutes.
10k/wav/3426.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel very strongly about that.
10k/wav/3430.wav|EN-US|EN| Not many companies can say that these days.
10k/wav/3442.wav|EN-US|EN| We've not taken any risks.
10k/wav/3449.wav|EN-US|EN| He is doing the right things.
10k/wav/3453.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to be dressed.
10k/wav/3457.wav|EN-US|EN| We spoke about a few people.
10k/wav/3463.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
10k/wav/3470.wav|EN-US|EN| He was just a journalist.
10k/wav/3478.wav|EN-US|EN| You are going to die.
10k/wav/3496.wav|EN-US|EN| It expected this trend to continue.
10k/wav/350.wav|EN-US|EN| The high straight is in Glasgow.
10k/wav/3511.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a high over effect.
10k/wav/3513.wav|EN-US|EN| I said my brothers, George, never saw that.
10k/wav/3524.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't looks actually have the same appeal.
10k/wav/3539.wav|EN-US|EN| He also admitted possessing a firearm.
10k/wav/355.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a big game for both of us.
10k/wav/3553.wav|EN-US|EN| We are the party of the future.
10k/wav/3571.wav|EN-US|EN| Harry plans to meet him on the summit.
10k/wav/3575.wav|EN-US|EN| It's really good as long as we play well.
10k/wav/3587.wav|EN-US|EN| until he hit the big gamers.
10k/wav/3605.wav|EN-US|EN| It will not happen overnight.
10k/wav/3617.wav|EN-US|EN| Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
10k/wav/3618.wav|EN-US|EN| The two companies were not for sale.
10k/wav/3623.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not needed. It should go.
10k/wav/3625.wav|EN-US|EN| The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
10k/wav/364.wav|EN-US|EN| She failed to win another game.
10k/wav/3655.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure that clubs will be delighted.
10k/wav/3656.wav|EN-US|EN| Then he did it twice.
10k/wav/3658.wav|EN-US|EN| The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
10k/wav/3664.wav|EN-US|EN| It wasn't very pretty to watch.
10k/wav/3667.wav|EN-US|EN| Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
10k/wav/3673.wav|EN-US|EN| The trial is funded solely by the Ambrosity Council.
10k/wav/3678.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't understand it.
10k/wav/3714.wav|EN-US|EN| Automation is the time of fulfillment.
10k/wav/3719.wav|EN-US|EN| One film here is he says his natural rhythm.
10k/wav/3723.wav|EN-US|EN| This film will be totally awesome.
10k/wav/3728.wav|EN-US|EN| Who did the recruiting?
10k/wav/374.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't want to do too much.
10k/wav/3740.wav|EN-US|EN| He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
10k/wav/3768.wav|EN-US|EN| They begot thy own agenda.
10k/wav/3778.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the future-ment.
10k/wav/3781.wav|EN-US|EN| Admission is free.
10k/wav/3796.wav|EN-US|EN| He makes time for everyone.
10k/wav/3803.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it was well worth the rate.
10k/wav/3826.wav|EN-US|EN| We understand the changes in the world.
10k/wav/387.wav|EN-US|EN| The sun has autism and other problems.
10k/wav/3870.wav|EN-US|EN| Action is needed now.
10k/wav/3876.wav|EN-US|EN| and this tournament will travel.
10k/wav/3877.wav|EN-US|EN| She has been shot.
10k/wav/3880.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no hiding place in it, no rumour for passengers.
10k/wav/3898.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a bunch of veterans.
10k/wav/3902.wav|EN-US|EN| What's that for?
10k/wav/3910.wav|EN-US|EN| The Chernobyl election is all to play for.
10k/wav/393.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be a bonus for this game.
10k/wav/3934.wav|EN-US|EN| It was on fire.
10k/wav/3945.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a technique.
10k/wav/395.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm an innocent man.
10k/wav/3953.wav|EN-US|EN| I last, in the third year, let it has arrived.
10k/wav/3964.wav|EN-US|EN| After his birthday Scott was very upset
10k/wav/3976.wav|EN-US|EN| The departure of Mr. Johnston was reported by the Herald yesterday.
10k/wav/3992.wav|EN-US|EN| Next league matches Dunte United Kilmarnock
10k/wav/3995.wav|EN-US|EN| I certainly hope not.
10k/wav/3996.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, the reasons are simple.
10k/wav/4001.wav|EN-US|EN| We've got a full house tonight.
10k/wav/4004.wav|EN-US|EN| We are working so hard.
10k/wav/4016.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the dreaded sentence.
10k/wav/4021.wav|EN-US|EN| There's still a bit to go
10k/wav/4037.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a great thing.
10k/wav/4039.wav|EN-US|EN| She returned home a few days later.
10k/wav/4047.wav|EN-US|EN| Since then it has become a tradition.
10k/wav/4050.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to let you down.
10k/wav/4075.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not at the property yesterday.
10k/wav/4080.wav|EN-US|EN| He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
10k/wav/4081.wav|EN-US|EN| 6 spoons of fresh snow peas, 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
10k/wav/4082.wav|EN-US|EN| The death rates are still as high.
10k/wav/4090.wav|EN-US|EN| They will run a mile.
10k/wav/4092.wav|EN-US|EN| We all want the same things.
10k/wav/4097.wav|EN-US|EN| And the winners us.
10k/wav/410.wav|EN-US|EN| I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
10k/wav/4102.wav|EN-US|EN| I have come here to share support from the families.
10k/wav/4149.wav|EN-US|EN| She always put the park too fast.
10k/wav/4150.wav|EN-US|EN| I have some comments
10k/wav/416.wav|EN-US|EN| And so it went on.
10k/wav/4166.wav|EN-US|EN| Visitors were also impressed.
10k/wav/417.wav|EN-US|EN| It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
10k/wav/4173.wav|EN-US|EN| However, we have not come to any conclusions.
10k/wav/4179.wav|EN-US|EN| It seemed the tough times were behind him.
10k/wav/4203.wav|EN-US|EN| It was just too much for us.
10k/wav/4205.wav|EN-US|EN| Willow is every bit as happy.
10k/wav/4211.wav|EN-US|EN| This is positive and welcome.
10k/wav/4214.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe that cap is no need there.
10k/wav/4225.wav|EN-US|EN| There has been no delay on government tortures.
10k/wav/4233.wav|EN-US|EN| The calls remained a mystery last night.
10k/wav/4239.wav|EN-US|EN| It is unusual.
10k/wav/4244.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a bit of a shock.
10k/wav/4256.wav|EN-US|EN| I took the gun.
10k/wav/4259.wav|EN-US|EN| We meet again in Berlin.
10k/wav/4260.wav|EN-US|EN| He added, however, that all options are under review
10k/wav/4261.wav|EN-US|EN| Who will attend?
10k/wav/4263.wav|EN-US|EN| It had been on the cots.
10k/wav/4268.wav|EN-US|EN| Since then, physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10k/wav/4272.wav|EN-US|EN| as we worked.
10k/wav/4293.wav|EN-US|EN| That team is due to be announced this morning.
10k/wav/4315.wav|EN-US|EN| My office is bad.
10k/wav/4318.wav|EN-US|EN| We would all have liked to run.
10k/wav/4329.wav|EN-US|EN| The atmosphere was electric.
10k/wav/4331.wav|EN-US|EN| What did you learn in school today?
10k/wav/4377.wav|EN-US|EN| An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
10k/wav/4394.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
10k/wav/4396.wav|EN-US|EN| And so did the rest of her team.
10k/wav/440.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a body play.
10k/wav/4404.wav|EN-US|EN| As if he would.
10k/wav/4425.wav|EN-US|EN| There was a lot of resentment.
10k/wav/4435.wav|EN-US|EN| He has made his base in Spain.
10k/wav/4449.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just the way I play.
10k/wav/4451.wav|EN-US|EN| But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
10k/wav/4465.wav|EN-US|EN| Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
10k/wav/4466.wav|EN-US|EN| They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
10k/wav/4483.wav|EN-US|EN| The party has never fully recovered.
10k/wav/4502.wav|EN-US|EN| Both men were injured
10k/wav/4519.wav|EN-US|EN| He always has been since his early days with Scottish opera.
10k/wav/452.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be great to win the title again.
10k/wav/4546.wav|EN-US|EN| I will take what comes along.
10k/wav/4572.wav|EN-US|EN| Would you have ever believed that was possible?
10k/wav/4591.wav|EN-US|EN| That was me today.
10k/wav/4622.wav|EN-US|EN| Here's to you in Israel tomorrow.
10k/wav/4627.wav|EN-US|EN| The driver just insulted me.
10k/wav/4630.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
10k/wav/4652.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd go to bookshops.
10k/wav/4656.wav|EN-US|EN| That is a personal matter.
10k/wav/4657.wav|EN-US|EN| Heat Tea will return.
10k/wav/4662.wav|EN-US|EN| It will benefit a lot of people.
10k/wav/467.wav|EN-US|EN| Indeed, it has already.
10k/wav/4690.wav|EN-US|EN| The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
10k/wav/4709.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything was up for grabs.
10k/wav/4710.wav|EN-US|EN| The idea is the shop was in the shop.
10k/wav/4712.wav|EN-US|EN| I've seen it work already.
10k/wav/4740.wav|EN-US|EN| I tried to push him away.
10k/wav/4741.wav|EN-US|EN| But this is just the start
10k/wav/4749.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very special for me.
10k/wav/4751.wav|EN-US|EN| We had him with us for the past six weeks.
10k/wav/4761.wav|EN-US|EN| But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
10k/wav/4784.wav|EN-US|EN| Only two things are certain.
10k/wav/479.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the icing on the cake.
10k/wav/4795.wav|EN-US|EN| We have not given up hope.
10k/wav/4796.wav|EN-US|EN| It is playing on, but it is also in beautiful condition.
10k/wav/4801.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just grateful he's alive.
10k/wav/4807.wav|EN-US|EN| They may be hopeless here, however.
10k/wav/4811.wav|EN-US|EN| I had no intention of misleading anyone.
10k/wav/482.wav|EN-US|EN| I knew there was a challenge for me.
10k/wav/4821.wav|EN-US|EN| We are so proud.
10k/wav/4822.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a temptation which should be resisted.
10k/wav/4833.wav|EN-US|EN| We certainly have to try something.
10k/wav/4848.wav|EN-US|EN| However, details have yet to be worked out
10k/wav/4851.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to drop out.
10k/wav/4864.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a new beginning.
10k/wav/4868.wav|EN-US|EN| Once they go away they want to come back.
10k/wav/4872.wav|EN-US|EN| Frank Horne is a great man.
10k/wav/4874.wav|EN-US|EN| There are no plans to change this.
10k/wav/4880.wav|EN-US|EN| You can see that point.
10k/wav/4882.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a struggle against Islam.
10k/wav/4897.wav|EN-US|EN| The hotel was an office sale.
10k/wav/49.wav|EN-US|EN| It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
10k/wav/4940.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a long term commitment.
10k/wav/4948.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody was able to escape.
10k/wav/4951.wav|EN-US|EN| Both promotions come as an surprise.
10k/wav/4953.wav|EN-US|EN| Today the Cremen would be contacted in seconds.
10k/wav/4955.wav|EN-US|EN| My dad was working in that show.
10k/wav/4957.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps it is jazzy.
10k/wav/4961.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the bank denied that he was in the running
10k/wav/4982.wav|EN-US|EN| The trial will open today.
10k/wav/5010.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to take some time.
10k/wav/5016.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just like the stock market.
10k/wav/5030.wav|EN-US|EN| The power are very much in love.
10k/wav/5032.wav|EN-US|EN| Five in a month isn't good enough.
10k/wav/5044.wav|EN-US|EN| It sounds like a wish list.
10k/wav/5047.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a commission and it's for work, years work.
10k/wav/505.wav|EN-US|EN| That had not happened on this occasion.
10k/wav/507.wav|EN-US|EN| There will not be any charges.
10k/wav/5082.wav|EN-US|EN| It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
10k/wav/5086.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be about commitment, not compliance.
10k/wav/5089.wav|EN-US|EN| I can see it now.
10k/wav/5092.wav|EN-US|EN| It is just part of modern day life.
10k/wav/5093.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, too many of them are similar.
10k/wav/512.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
10k/wav/5124.wav|EN-US|EN| What is a house without it?
10k/wav/5131.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the logic of punishment assaults.
10k/wav/5152.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a sad day.
10k/wav/5200.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been working closely with Holote.
10k/wav/5203.wav|EN-US|EN| The police believed that the man was not injured.
10k/wav/5222.wav|EN-US|EN| For clear reasons, he believed he needed to come home.
10k/wav/5223.wav|EN-US|EN| I've invented a village in East Lothian.
10k/wav/5242.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a much bigger problem.
10k/wav/5244.wav|EN-US|EN| But what's this all about?
10k/wav/5247.wav|EN-US|EN| Try to save us.
10k/wav/526.wav|EN-US|EN| But he's a very quiet man.
10k/wav/5262.wav|EN-US|EN| This may be perfectly innocent.
10k/wav/5268.wav|EN-US|EN| He know it's in Edinburgh with his off car alone
10k/wav/5270.wav|EN-US|EN| This is good news for the industry.
10k/wav/5284.wav|EN-US|EN| But hey it is also very bad.
10k/wav/5287.wav|EN-US|EN| The driver was in touch.
10k/wav/5290.wav|EN-US|EN| Kingfisher reports interim figures to Mo.
10k/wav/5301.wav|EN-US|EN| You ask the question.
10k/wav/5304.wav|EN-US|EN| It benefits the health family.
10k/wav/5306.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very sorry to hear about this.
10k/wav/5308.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a lovely man.
10k/wav/5311.wav|EN-US|EN| So what is the problem?
10k/wav/5319.wav|EN-US|EN| He gave no other details.
10k/wav/532.wav|EN-US|EN| Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
10k/wav/5396.wav|EN-US|EN| But we wouldn't want them any other way.
10k/wav/5407.wav|EN-US|EN| it is but that's not the point
10k/wav/5419.wav|EN-US|EN| I just made it.
10k/wav/5427.wav|EN-US|EN| He is already in place.
10k/wav/5430.wav|EN-US|EN| And you should go now.
10k/wav/5443.wav|EN-US|EN| It is my favourite place to hang out.
10k/wav/5448.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be a big mistake.
10k/wav/5461.wav|EN-US|EN| Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give litter away.
10k/wav/5476.wav|EN-US|EN| If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
10k/wav/5481.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night, Bush carried it rather easily.
10k/wav/5499.wav|EN-US|EN| Our house was very small.
10k/wav/5503.wav|EN-US|EN| History is in the making.
10k/wav/5504.wav|EN-US|EN| You are talking about a matter of life and death.
10k/wav/5505.wav|EN-US|EN| They were a lovely couple.
10k/wav/5509.wav|EN-US|EN| If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
10k/wav/5516.wav|EN-US|EN| Working with him is like working with myself.
10k/wav/5521.wav|EN-US|EN| Who does he think will win?
10k/wav/5537.wav|EN-US|EN| A whole range of factors are involved.
10k/wav/5538.wav|EN-US|EN| They are just bewildered and very concerned
10k/wav/5539.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lot of hysteria.
10k/wav/5540.wav|EN-US|EN| In the end, however, it all came together
10k/wav/5551.wav|EN-US|EN| They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
10k/wav/5575.wav|EN-US|EN| Our Great Depression is our lifts.
10k/wav/5579.wav|EN-US|EN| The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
10k/wav/5582.wav|EN-US|EN| This is totally out of character for Stuart.
10k/wav/5591.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a big club.
10k/wav/5599.wav|EN-US|EN| The team for the faster game could be this one.
10k/wav/56.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's the truth.
10k/wav/5612.wav|EN-US|EN| The output price index in December wasn't changed till November.
10k/wav/5628.wav|EN-US|EN| His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
10k/wav/5636.wav|EN-US|EN| My dad is a hero.
10k/wav/5650.wav|EN-US|EN| We have an attorney on the ground.
10k/wav/5664.wav|EN-US|EN| I was independent, but I'm not there.
10k/wav/5677.wav|EN-US|EN| We will just get on with it.
10k/wav/5686.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not descent to kill.
10k/wav/5694.wav|EN-US|EN| and the New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
10k/wav/5697.wav|EN-US|EN| That is exactly right.
10k/wav/5703.wav|EN-US|EN| I just don't know what she was doing.
10k/wav/5706.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the last thing on my mind.
10k/wav/5719.wav|EN-US|EN| Four had been brought down.
10k/wav/5733.wav|EN-US|EN| If only it were so.
10k/wav/5740.wav|EN-US|EN| On the contrary, there's tant to cane.
10k/wav/5746.wav|EN-US|EN| We will then move forward.
10k/wav/5748.wav|EN-US|EN| The train was on time.
10k/wav/575.wav|EN-US|EN| He was unprepared for this fight.
10k/wav/5766.wav|EN-US|EN| We have some consents.
10k/wav/5774.wav|EN-US|EN| There are no other contenders.
10k/wav/579.wav|EN-US|EN| This is my music.
10k/wav/58.wav|EN-US|EN| It seemed to have direction.
10k/wav/5809.wav|EN-US|EN| We gave everything we had.
10k/wav/5815.wav|EN-US|EN| That could be at least five years away.
10k/wav/5828.wav|EN-US|EN| It's such a tragedy.
10k/wav/5829.wav|EN-US|EN| He was correct in everything he did.
10k/wav/5835.wav|EN-US|EN| It's quite a line up.
10k/wav/5841.wav|EN-US|EN| The government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
10k/wav/5844.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing would not surprise me.
10k/wav/5863.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been there many times.
10k/wav/5865.wav|EN-US|EN| We had a great time.
10k/wav/5885.wav|EN-US|EN| This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
10k/wav/5897.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
10k/wav/5899.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
10k/wav/5905.wav|EN-US|EN| We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
10k/wav/5907.wav|EN-US|EN| Leiper has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
10k/wav/5912.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a genuine budget in place.
10k/wav/5918.wav|EN-US|EN| I tend to not log back.
10k/wav/5923.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't really. We just made that up.
10k/wav/5946.wav|EN-US|EN| We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
10k/wav/5952.wav|EN-US|EN| I am confident of the outcome this week.
10k/wav/5958.wav|EN-US|EN| I never had an aerial direction at school.
10k/wav/597.wav|EN-US|EN| We don't know what is happening to them.
10k/wav/5990.wav|EN-US|EN| So what is it with NATO?
10k/wav/6002.wav|EN-US|EN| It was that kind of night.
10k/wav/6005.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the lesson to be learnt from the European Championships.
10k/wav/6017.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it proved to be the turning point.
10k/wav/6031.wav|EN-US|EN| I've never been nominated on drugs.
10k/wav/605.wav|EN-US|EN| Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
10k/wav/6051.wav|EN-US|EN| The lottery has helped.
10k/wav/6057.wav|EN-US|EN| Since then, physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10k/wav/6070.wav|EN-US|EN| Wind tell of discontent awaits.
10k/wav/6072.wav|EN-US|EN| The compromise is entirely only I've allowed that position.
10k/wav/6103.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no change in our position.
10k/wav/6125.wav|EN-US|EN| It should not make the same mistake again.
10k/wav/6156.wav|EN-US|EN| I think he was lost for words.
10k/wav/617.wav|EN-US|EN| He was all blackened.
10k/wav/6171.wav|EN-US|EN| That comes at a cost.
10k/wav/6182.wav|EN-US|EN| You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
10k/wav/6200.wav|EN-US|EN| For this government, reform and resources go together.
10k/wav/6216.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the fact of the matter.
10k/wav/6221.wav|EN-US|EN| I must make that clear.
10k/wav/6222.wav|EN-US|EN| I have no problem with that.
10k/wav/6226.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't want to hear any excuses.
10k/wav/6253.wav|EN-US|EN| Every player goes through the soft or serious injury.
10k/wav/6259.wav|EN-US|EN| I expected these kind of questions.
10k/wav/6263.wav|EN-US|EN| The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
10k/wav/6266.wav|EN-US|EN| And rangers think they have problems.
10k/wav/6276.wav|EN-US|EN| We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
10k/wav/6278.wav|EN-US|EN| Folk music is in her plot.
10k/wav/6290.wav|EN-US|EN| They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the Justice Minister.
10k/wav/6298.wav|EN-US|EN| This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
10k/wav/6308.wav|EN-US|EN| My son was too young to die.
10k/wav/6315.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no mention of a namaste in the Pelfast agreement.
10k/wav/6358.wav|EN-US|EN| It should be a condition of employment.
10k/wav/6362.wav|EN-US|EN| You're right, the same goal currency is a fact.
10k/wav/6363.wav|EN-US|EN| One Law, however, was in self-criticised yesterday.
10k/wav/6384.wav|EN-US|EN| He had worked there for only two days.
10k/wav/639.wav|EN-US|EN| The group will also become an internet service provider.
10k/wav/643.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm Jamarak.
10k/wav/6449.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Forest reacted angrily.
10k/wav/6453.wav|EN-US|EN| He added, we are not prepared for war.
10k/wav/6465.wav|EN-US|EN| Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
10k/wav/6486.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't want me to leave the house.
10k/wav/6488.wav|EN-US|EN| The council has been open and transparent.
10k/wav/650.wav|EN-US|EN| The document tag is that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
10k/wav/6510.wav|EN-US|EN| Which is thus?
10k/wav/6522.wav|EN-US|EN| What is their concern?
10k/wav/6534.wav|EN-US|EN| It is extremely sad.
10k/wav/6537.wav|EN-US|EN| They have been very lucky with us.
10k/wav/6539.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be working on that this week. All right.
10k/wav/6550.wav|EN-US|EN| Was it worth it?
10k/wav/6588.wav|EN-US|EN| I chose to make a film.
10k/wav/659.wav|EN-US|EN| Anika is very, very fit
10k/wav/660.wav|EN-US|EN| Hanman has been warned.
10k/wav/6606.wav|EN-US|EN| So, what's it about?
10k/wav/6611.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night he became one of the hunted.
10k/wav/662.wav|EN-US|EN| Once again a strong services performance helped the overall trading position.
10k/wav/6648.wav|EN-US|EN| The humans are not good.
10k/wav/6654.wav|EN-US|EN| But happily, the story is true
10k/wav/6656.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that where we are?
10k/wav/666.wav|EN-US|EN| It has removed a bit of gut.
10k/wav/6686.wav|EN-US|EN| He really says he has set a glass to him.
10k/wav/6698.wav|EN-US|EN| Their vision was not impeded.
10k/wav/6717.wav|EN-US|EN| though our companies would be asked to contribute.
10k/wav/673.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd been up with my girlfriend and we were tacked.
10k/wav/6740.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not a fan of books.
10k/wav/6746.wav|EN-US|EN| This must be wrong.
10k/wav/6748.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel confident about the outcome.
10k/wav/6768.wav|EN-US|EN| They didn't take you to mass graves.
10k/wav/6780.wav|EN-US|EN| The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
10k/wav/6781.wav|EN-US|EN| As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
10k/wav/6791.wav|EN-US|EN| The weekly average was 3 hours
10k/wav/6796.wav|EN-US|EN| They may not always be so lucky.
10k/wav/6800.wav|EN-US|EN| If successful, several records will be made.
10k/wav/6807.wav|EN-US|EN| We are in the endgame.
10k/wav/6818.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going through the process.
10k/wav/6822.wav|EN-US|EN| We had another last Tuesday.
10k/wav/6825.wav|EN-US|EN| He loved it and so did they.
10k/wav/6826.wav|EN-US|EN| Just watch the videos and you will see it.
10k/wav/6829.wav|EN-US|EN| Strathcai police yesterday declined to comment on forest.
10k/wav/6833.wav|EN-US|EN| This is as bad as it can put.
10k/wav/6866.wav|EN-US|EN| It can be very weighing.
10k/wav/6878.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps we should learn something from them.
10k/wav/6880.wav|EN-US|EN| The guys have really enjoyed it.
10k/wav/6883.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like the Russians.
10k/wav/6892.wav|EN-US|EN| I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
10k/wav/691.wav|EN-US|EN| We will talk about Mr Michael Johnson and he is awesome.
10k/wav/6910.wav|EN-US|EN| I have a chance.
10k/wav/6913.wav|EN-US|EN| Akale, that was genuine novelty being recognised.
10k/wav/6917.wav|EN-US|EN| The key to the HEAL project will be environmental concern.
10k/wav/6923.wav|EN-US|EN| He hadn't had them for a long time.
10k/wav/6927.wav|EN-US|EN| I agree with them.
10k/wav/6928.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not that sadistic.
10k/wav/6935.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no safety net.
10k/wav/6941.wav|EN-US|EN| David Trimble has sold out.
10k/wav/6942.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a total and a change of culture.
10k/wav/6945.wav|EN-US|EN| Aement was always on the outside.
10k/wav/6956.wav|EN-US|EN| She said no, he's not in Elgin today.
10k/wav/6999.wav|EN-US|EN| One person was believed to have been hit.
10k/wav/7001.wav|EN-US|EN| The choice is strictly personal.
10k/wav/7004.wav|EN-US|EN| Will you just put it away?
10k/wav/7007.wav|EN-US|EN| We are Nye Pen.
10k/wav/7010.wav|EN-US|EN| The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
10k/wav/7012.wav|EN-US|EN| The First Minister is an addict.
10k/wav/7019.wav|EN-US|EN| It is as wide as the church in there.
10k/wav/7026.wav|EN-US|EN| I could have got out a long time ago.
10k/wav/7062.wav|EN-US|EN| However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
10k/wav/7066.wav|EN-US|EN| That is not good for golf.
10k/wav/7080.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a real concern.
10k/wav/7082.wav|EN-US|EN| He said it was his greatest work.
10k/wav/7093.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to be enforced.
10k/wav/7103.wav|EN-US|EN| I made a big mistake.
10k/wav/712.wav|EN-US|EN| Two other men have recovered.
10k/wav/7126.wav|EN-US|EN| But we will have to wait.
10k/wav/7127.wav|EN-US|EN| Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
10k/wav/713.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just outrageous.
10k/wav/7130.wav|EN-US|EN| This season has been great for me, it's been an experience
10k/wav/7137.wav|EN-US|EN| It almost certain is.
10k/wav/718.wav|EN-US|EN| Carl Schrader was the victor.
10k/wav/7187.wav|EN-US|EN| It could not be too high.
10k/wav/7189.wav|EN-US|EN| It's all designed to speed up the service.
10k/wav/72.wav|EN-US|EN| However, we have to be cautious.
10k/wav/7201.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish prison service.
10k/wav/7225.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd be no passion for any country.
10k/wav/7232.wav|EN-US|EN| One step's decision came as a surprise.
10k/wav/7233.wav|EN-US|EN| It's too big a risk to take.
10k/wav/7234.wav|EN-US|EN| This time, it will not be.
10k/wav/7257.wav|EN-US|EN| If you have to pay for treatment you pay for treatment.
10k/wav/7258.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
10k/wav/7273.wav|EN-US|EN| There was barely a handful of chances.
10k/wav/728.wav|EN-US|EN| Sub not used with coke.
10k/wav/7284.wav|EN-US|EN| A Parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
10k/wav/7308.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very close.
10k/wav/731.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a lifeline.
10k/wav/7319.wav|EN-US|EN| I persuade it to change his mind.
10k/wav/7322.wav|EN-US|EN| The trading conditions are not good.
10k/wav/7326.wav|EN-US|EN| There is always a case.
10k/wav/7338.wav|EN-US|EN| If the red of the second bar falls upon the green of the fast, the result is to give a bar with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light were mixed forms yellow.
10k/wav/7344.wav|EN-US|EN| It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
10k/wav/7346.wav|EN-US|EN| The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
10k/wav/7371.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sure that they will learn
10k/wav/7375.wav|EN-US|EN| It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
10k/wav/7376.wav|EN-US|EN| Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
10k/wav/7380.wav|EN-US|EN| She had not suffered any physical injury.
10k/wav/7389.wav|EN-US|EN| It happened again and again and again.
10k/wav/7391.wav|EN-US|EN| Then another one came.
10k/wav/740.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope you don't regret it.
10k/wav/7401.wav|EN-US|EN| It will make a huge difference.
10k/wav/7408.wav|EN-US|EN| You can see how the mate is money.
10k/wav/7415.wav|EN-US|EN| It hasn't happened but other things have.
10k/wav/7422.wav|EN-US|EN| There's no evidence he was ever there.
10k/wav/7433.wav|EN-US|EN| You need a license to run a pub.
10k/wav/745.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never seen anything like this.
10k/wav/7454.wav|EN-US|EN| The families are gone.
10k/wav/7463.wav|EN-US|EN| U.S. to it has other ideas
10k/wav/7464.wav|EN-US|EN| He will be advised by me.
10k/wav/7465.wav|EN-US|EN| You have to audition for jobs.
10k/wav/7467.wav|EN-US|EN| We are aware of the two incidents.
10k/wav/7470.wav|EN-US|EN| Do you think we wrote operation?
10k/wav/7475.wav|EN-US|EN| It is normal.
10k/wav/7482.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel a little betrayed.
10k/wav/7486.wav|EN-US|EN| What's the best thing to do?
10k/wav/7489.wav|EN-US|EN| This reason is to do as the nature of the Scotland manager.
10k/wav/7505.wav|EN-US|EN| It is also very valuable.
10k/wav/7506.wav|EN-US|EN| It certainly feels that way.
10k/wav/7507.wav|EN-US|EN| That is why it is so special.
10k/wav/7534.wav|EN-US|EN| An English Parliament was never a serious option.
10k/wav/7556.wav|EN-US|EN| It would have been very easily done.
10k/wav/7579.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the start of a new campaign.
10k/wav/7587.wav|EN-US|EN| They might also be powerless.
10k/wav/7600.wav|EN-US|EN| A government is a government is a government.
10k/wav/7601.wav|EN-US|EN| All the investment is possible from the public sector.
10k/wav/7607.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
10k/wav/7620.wav|EN-US|EN| The attacker died in the crash.
10k/wav/7628.wav|EN-US|EN| The vacancies are in support services and knots.
10k/wav/7635.wav|EN-US|EN| If we live forever, can we really be sad to live?
10k/wav/7639.wav|EN-US|EN| Not, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
10k/wav/7641.wav|EN-US|EN| Look at a computer.
10k/wav/7652.wav|EN-US|EN| We can make a difference.
10k/wav/7655.wav|EN-US|EN| Yet the evidence is plain to see.
10k/wav/7674.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a game we had to win.
10k/wav/7686.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the National Sport.
10k/wav/7690.wav|EN-US|EN| We shall not forget him.
10k/wav/7697.wav|EN-US|EN| This would discourage investment and job creation.
10k/wav/7705.wav|EN-US|EN| He laughed pretty quickly.
10k/wav/772.wav|EN-US|EN| I played well but missed a few chances.
10k/wav/7732.wav|EN-US|EN| He didn't win the title.
10k/wav/7753.wav|EN-US|EN| It has come as a bombshell.
10k/wav/7762.wav|EN-US|EN| those who are preparing to give up.
10k/wav/7771.wav|EN-US|EN| On the front line, beyond the bridge, the scene was utter cares.
10k/wav/7781.wav|EN-US|EN| Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
10k/wav/7782.wav|EN-US|EN| No such remedy has ever been pursued.
10k/wav/7786.wav|EN-US|EN| For now, we must take one game at a time.
10k/wav/7789.wav|EN-US|EN| His remake is specific.
10k/wav/7791.wav|EN-US|EN| Despite Labor's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
10k/wav/780.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a good reason for this.
10k/wav/7804.wav|EN-US|EN| She said she would not welcome the flowers.
10k/wav/7821.wav|EN-US|EN| Was it a signal?
10k/wav/7822.wav|EN-US|EN| Our pit revision was required.
10k/wav/784.wav|EN-US|EN| It possibly depends on the position.
10k/wav/7850.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no issue of national security involved here.
10k/wav/7854.wav|EN-US|EN| such as it is.
10k/wav/7857.wav|EN-US|EN| It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
10k/wav/7869.wav|EN-US|EN| I wonder if Ranges do that.
10k/wav/7871.wav|EN-US|EN| I just didn't turn up, by the way.
10k/wav/7876.wav|EN-US|EN| Note the date
10k/wav/7883.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope he would have been very pleased.
10k/wav/7888.wav|EN-US|EN| I was delighted to accept.
10k/wav/7889.wav|EN-US|EN| It just could be a good night.
10k/wav/7894.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly, The Need for a Personal Loan is written in the stars.
10k/wav/7895.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been thinking about that this week.
10k/wav/7907.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't know them or anything.
10k/wav/7929.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
10k/wav/7932.wav|EN-US|EN| He said to give a local injection.
10k/wav/7935.wav|EN-US|EN| Millions of British jobs depend on them.
10k/wav/7937.wav|EN-US|EN| A specs woman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
10k/wav/7946.wav|EN-US|EN| I was awful.
10k/wav/7951.wav|EN-US|EN| Councilor Fishers are involved along with the transport industry.
10k/wav/7956.wav|EN-US|EN| must be prepared to use it.
10k/wav/796.wav|EN-US|EN| His potty was found in May.
10k/wav/7962.wav|EN-US|EN| I have played really well here.
10k/wav/7964.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been coming here for nine years.
10k/wav/7968.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a fairly handsome and enjoyable production.
10k/wav/7975.wav|EN-US|EN| We have reacted well to each other.
10k/wav/7976.wav|EN-US|EN| Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by a reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
10k/wav/7979.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the kind of production it was.
10k/wav/7989.wav|EN-US|EN| But real life is not like that.
10k/wav/7991.wav|EN-US|EN| The cause is just...
10k/wav/7997.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe we have a good chance.
10k/wav/8008.wav|EN-US|EN| We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
10k/wav/8019.wav|EN-US|EN| COBIC provision continued to be good.
10k/wav/802.wav|EN-US|EN| My mother is a widow.
10k/wav/8042.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a spring in this step.
10k/wav/8064.wav|EN-US|EN| I reported it but nothing was done.
10k/wav/8068.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be fine.
10k/wav/8072.wav|EN-US|EN| He is trying really hard
10k/wav/8075.wav|EN-US|EN| You name the type.
10k/wav/8092.wav|EN-US|EN| The ass-pace above the theatre was closed off.
10k/wav/8093.wav|EN-US|EN| The performance was really, really immense.
10k/wav/8096.wav|EN-US|EN| They will have to make changes.
10k/wav/8107.wav|EN-US|EN| And now the pressure is off.
10k/wav/8133.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
10k/wav/8141.wav|EN-US|EN| There's the mix.
10k/wav/8143.wav|EN-US|EN| Things fall little flat elsewhere, however.
10k/wav/8153.wav|EN-US|EN| It's never been to committee.
10k/wav/8159.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a problem.
10k/wav/8161.wav|EN-US|EN| Britain will be little affected.
10k/wav/8169.wav|EN-US|EN| There we came, but not very good.
10k/wav/8174.wav|EN-US|EN| He was shaking like a leaf.
10k/wav/8193.wav|EN-US|EN| The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
10k/wav/8201.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no substitute.
10k/wav/8218.wav|EN-US|EN| This is his personal life.
10k/wav/8223.wav|EN-US|EN| However, that is not in itself enough.
10k/wav/8226.wav|EN-US|EN| Wahout is with the artist.
10k/wav/8234.wav|EN-US|EN| Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
10k/wav/8251.wav|EN-US|EN| The wedding was in Edinburgh.
10k/wav/8252.wav|EN-US|EN| It needs a team approach.
10k/wav/8255.wav|EN-US|EN| It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
10k/wav/8259.wav|EN-US|EN| The internet is no substitute for customer service.
10k/wav/8292.wav|EN-US|EN| Eye condition is not bad.
10k/wav/8293.wav|EN-US|EN| Why do you think she is going?
10k/wav/8299.wav|EN-US|EN| I will get with him any time.
10k/wav/830.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no option.
10k/wav/8303.wav|EN-US|EN| There has been a big change in defence.
10k/wav/8308.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lot of her in about
10k/wav/831.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been in two finals and I've got a medal.
10k/wav/8320.wav|EN-US|EN| Well the pressure will be on him.
10k/wav/8326.wav|EN-US|EN| Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good
10k/wav/833.wav|EN-US|EN| The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
10k/wav/8334.wav|EN-US|EN| I haven't made the donation yet.
10k/wav/8338.wav|EN-US|EN| I know we can play a lot better.
10k/wav/8339.wav|EN-US|EN| Shell, this is a very important event for me.
10k/wav/8343.wav|EN-US|EN| He has not been named.
10k/wav/8347.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
10k/wav/8367.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been here on numerous occasions.
10k/wav/837.wav|EN-US|EN| Nobody will be forced to work.
10k/wav/8370.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be all about the Olympics.
10k/wav/8376.wav|EN-US|EN| Instead we were shot in the back.
10k/wav/8378.wav|EN-US|EN| The budget is a boost for Scottish business.
10k/wav/8379.wav|EN-US|EN| I could have been offended.
10k/wav/8386.wav|EN-US|EN| Alt is X true.
10k/wav/8388.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think that he want to be released.
10k/wav/8392.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not like working for a living.
10k/wav/8394.wav|EN-US|EN| But still, it wasn't working.
10k/wav/8400.wav|EN-US|EN| But it has all been worthwhile.
10k/wav/8409.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not making any comment at all.
10k/wav/8417.wav|EN-US|EN| The website is planned for November.
10k/wav/842.wav|EN-US|EN| She's now on the backbenches.
10k/wav/8439.wav|EN-US|EN| Once again, they would be wrong
10k/wav/8442.wav|EN-US|EN| But the tragedy did not stop there.
10k/wav/8443.wav|EN-US|EN| How'd she enjoy the experience?
10k/wav/8460.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the ride package for Scotland.
10k/wav/8468.wav|EN-US|EN| Kidra crops have always been recognised by successful farmers.
10k/wav/8472.wav|EN-US|EN| Night was serious.
10k/wav/8483.wav|EN-US|EN| Have a look at our accounts.
10k/wav/8503.wav|EN-US|EN| So, did she meet him?
10k/wav/851.wav|EN-US|EN| The medal itself is not that important.
10k/wav/8510.wav|EN-US|EN| It is recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
10k/wav/8511.wav|EN-US|EN| I do always want to act.
10k/wav/8536.wav|EN-US|EN| I have chosen to do this research.
10k/wav/8556.wav|EN-US|EN| The house was so well light.
10k/wav/8557.wav|EN-US|EN| I did say, aching the positive case for Scottish new labour.
10k/wav/8561.wav|EN-US|EN| The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
10k/wav/8567.wav|EN-US|EN| to which there are no answers that don't hold your breath.
10k/wav/8568.wav|EN-US|EN| He could look after himself, but didn't he?
10k/wav/8580.wav|EN-US|EN| The consultant's report commissioned by the previous government was not published.
10k/wav/8584.wav|EN-US|EN| and they went on to win the title.
10k/wav/8590.wav|EN-US|EN| He was admitted to hospital.
10k/wav/8593.wav|EN-US|EN| It was submitted without their knowledge.
10k/wav/8602.wav|EN-US|EN| I think he has undergone a sea change.
10k/wav/8630.wav|EN-US|EN| The fast victory made a huge difference to my career.
10k/wav/8633.wav|EN-US|EN| So I did.
10k/wav/8649.wav|EN-US|EN| It's Court to Supreme Court for a reason.
10k/wav/8660.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
10k/wav/8663.wav|EN-US|EN| He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth
10k/wav/8674.wav|EN-US|EN| The confidence is low but it is a difficult thing to understand.
10k/wav/8688.wav|EN-US|EN| He needed seven eyes at surgery.
10k/wav/8701.wav|EN-US|EN| With PR, you can never be sure.
10k/wav/8706.wav|EN-US|EN| Will Bank may offer you a choice of options.
10k/wav/8710.wav|EN-US|EN| Five minutes later the home team were back in front.
10k/wav/8712.wav|EN-US|EN| On his first public appearance, Mr Cameron found himself under fire.
10k/wav/8717.wav|EN-US|EN| I thump just a piece in the jigsaw.
10k/wav/8721.wav|EN-US|EN| What do you think they said?
10k/wav/8742.wav|EN-US|EN| It's about attitudes to change.
10k/wav/8743.wav|EN-US|EN| Our legal advice is clear.
10k/wav/8744.wav|EN-US|EN| It would also take time.
10k/wav/8754.wav|EN-US|EN| I can't deny that fact.
10k/wav/8757.wav|EN-US|EN| Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
10k/wav/8769.wav|EN-US|EN| The latter can only account for a small proportion of cores.
10k/wav/8776.wav|EN-US|EN| He did that last Sunday.
10k/wav/8786.wav|EN-US|EN| The tie isn't over.
10k/wav/8787.wav|EN-US|EN| It also indicated that her condition undeterriated.
10k/wav/8803.wav|EN-US|EN| The warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
10k/wav/8809.wav|EN-US|EN| It was all too late, too late.
10k/wav/8818.wav|EN-US|EN| I will be in Scotland.
10k/wav/8848.wav|EN-US|EN| She has not been registered as disabled.
10k/wav/8850.wav|EN-US|EN| These will finally be collected by next week.
10k/wav/8855.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very excited about this season.
10k/wav/8860.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm happy to be here.
10k/wav/8871.wav|EN-US|EN| Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
10k/wav/8876.wav|EN-US|EN| Chuck was always going to win this one.
10k/wav/8879.wav|EN-US|EN| Friday night was a pretty good night
10k/wav/8885.wav|EN-US|EN| You will receive the adverts.
10k/wav/8910.wav|EN-US|EN| This fight is not going to go away.
10k/wav/8917.wav|EN-US|EN| It had happened on average once a week this year.
10k/wav/8929.wav|EN-US|EN| Truth is the child of time.
10k/wav/8943.wav|EN-US|EN| The only plus point is the reduction in crime.
10k/wav/8946.wav|EN-US|EN| It was tough but we did have a lot of possession.
10k/wav/896.wav|EN-US|EN| It teased the tape of the ice book.
10k/wav/8963.wav|EN-US|EN| It was meant to rival the dollar.
10k/wav/9006.wav|EN-US|EN| The day may come but not for a while.
10k/wav/9010.wav|EN-US|EN| This is it finally finished.
10k/wav/9015.wav|EN-US|EN| It is patently true.
10k/wav/9026.wav|EN-US|EN| There's nothing natural left.
10k/wav/9028.wav|EN-US|EN| He was very close.
10k/wav/9029.wav|EN-US|EN| It is about investing in the future.
10k/wav/9041.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is a fact.
10k/wav/9047.wav|EN-US|EN| I was scared.
10k/wav/9051.wav|EN-US|EN| But they will not be compelled to join.
10k/wav/9063.wav|EN-US|EN| The Dutchman was intent to see the breakthrough.
10k/wav/9084.wav|EN-US|EN| Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
10k/wav/9093.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a huge experience.
10k/wav/912.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the nature of his party.
10k/wav/9138.wav|EN-US|EN| We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
10k/wav/915.wav|EN-US|EN| Many other areas are coming up.
10k/wav/9162.wav|EN-US|EN| Does a lot of drawing.
10k/wav/9166.wav|EN-US|EN| They can be time consuming.
10k/wav/9168.wav|EN-US|EN| They didn't find any substance.
10k/wav/9178.wav|EN-US|EN| We believe it to be completely without merit.
10k/wav/9181.wav|EN-US|EN| which perhaps suggests as well.
10k/wav/9196.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been very nervous.
10k/wav/9201.wav|EN-US|EN| We have waited a long time for this.
10k/wav/9211.wav|EN-US|EN| He is keen to stay in public service.
10k/wav/9231.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a player.
10k/wav/9233.wav|EN-US|EN| Tralea you will
10k/wav/9237.wav|EN-US|EN| I help families.
10k/wav/9240.wav|EN-US|EN| The part was making a visual approach.
10k/wav/9246.wav|EN-US|EN| She's afraid of life.
10k/wav/9248.wav|EN-US|EN| They were the better side on the day.
10k/wav/9262.wav|EN-US|EN| Inclusion and autism, is it working?
10k/wav/9272.wav|EN-US|EN| The group would never be the same again.
10k/wav/9281.wav|EN-US|EN| After that time the market itself will set the prices.
10k/wav/9290.wav|EN-US|EN| It's to do with this place.
10k/wav/9293.wav|EN-US|EN| We need a much wider debate.
10k/wav/9296.wav|EN-US|EN| I was so relieved
10k/wav/9297.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to move forward together.
10k/wav/9303.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
10k/wav/9308.wav|EN-US|EN| It had to be more flexible.
10k/wav/9314.wav|EN-US|EN| That is the key message.
10k/wav/932.wav|EN-US|EN| The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
10k/wav/9327.wav|EN-US|EN| He has worked hard over the years.
10k/wav/9341.wav|EN-US|EN| They want this research to continue.
10k/wav/9347.wav|EN-US|EN| The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
10k/wav/9382.wav|EN-US|EN| They should feel ashamed.
10k/wav/9384.wav|EN-US|EN| I code only have asked for better.
10k/wav/9387.wav|EN-US|EN| He had a heart problem.
10k/wav/9419.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be the case with Dundee.
10k/wav/9426.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a young man with a needle.
10k/wav/9440.wav|EN-US|EN| It had not been a terribly inspiring event, either.
10k/wav/9474.wav|EN-US|EN| It doesn't look good.
10k/wav/9475.wav|EN-US|EN| The document is a starting point for discussion.
10k/wav/9494.wav|EN-US|EN| It was one on the issue of the land.
10k/wav/9509.wav|EN-US|EN| We must move them.
10k/wav/9522.wav|EN-US|EN| They are used to it
10k/wav/9537.wav|EN-US|EN| Next league marchers, Dundee United Rangers
10k/wav/9555.wav|EN-US|EN| But her parents will never see her again.
10k/wav/9568.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to help them for it.
10k/wav/9580.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he emphasized the bank was satisfied with progress.
10k/wav/9586.wav|EN-US|EN| But there is no easy option.
10k/wav/9591.wav|EN-US|EN| This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
10k/wav/9596.wav|EN-US|EN| They will appear again next week.
10k/wav/9598.wav|EN-US|EN| So the European elections are extremely important.
10k/wav/9616.wav|EN-US|EN| He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
10k/wav/9618.wav|EN-US|EN| These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
10k/wav/9626.wav|EN-US|EN| We can do nothing about that.
10k/wav/9628.wav|EN-US|EN| And that gives a kind of freedom.
10k/wav/9631.wav|EN-US|EN| He almost admitted as much.
10k/wav/965.wav|EN-US|EN| Then there is the train
10k/wav/9651.wav|EN-US|EN| Mummy believed in one thing before.
10k/wav/9657.wav|EN-US|EN| We are still hopeful of concluding the deal.
10k/wav/9676.wav|EN-US|EN| We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
10k/wav/9679.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr. Mason is claiming an fire dismissal.
10k/wav/9685.wav|EN-US|EN| We thought we were looking in good shape.
10k/wav/9687.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a simple equation.
10k/wav/9702.wav|EN-US|EN| We did everything by the book.
10k/wav/9720.wav|EN-US|EN| What you saw, you have to reap.
10k/wav/9723.wav|EN-US|EN| Those overseas offices were great.
10k/wav/9728.wav|EN-US|EN| That has been the easy part.
10k/wav/9733.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the National Great.
10k/wav/9745.wav|EN-US|EN| Are we going to stay up?
10k/wav/9749.wav|EN-US|EN| Best leaders were joined by senior party victors.
10k/wav/9750.wav|EN-US|EN| It's worth it, though.
10k/wav/9767.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been in place since last July.
10k/wav/9773.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a recipe for disaster.
10k/wav/9793.wav|EN-US|EN| That says something for his strength of character.
10k/wav/9823.wav|EN-US|EN| On recent evidence he will not be missed.
10k/wav/983.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Bloe last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
10k/wav/9843.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a love affair.
10k/wav/9848.wav|EN-US|EN| Her father wasn't the best pleased.
10k/wav/9851.wav|EN-US|EN| We can't determine that clearly.
10k/wav/986.wav|EN-US|EN| I tend not to look back.
10k/wav/9868.wav|EN-US|EN| He had suffered a heart attack.
10k/wav/9878.wav|EN-US|EN| Green is desperate to play in the open.
10k/wav/9892.wav|EN-US|EN| Stevenson was tested on Monday morning.
10k/wav/9893.wav|EN-US|EN| I would not descend to that level.
10k/wav/9896.wav|EN-US|EN| Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
10k/wav/9923.wav|EN-US|EN| She is not in a coma.
10k/wav/9931.wav|EN-US|EN| You will never forget the clutching whore.
10k/wav/9933.wav|EN-US|EN| The English are coming
10k/wav/9939.wav|EN-US|EN| Let it seem to work.
10k/wav/994.wav|EN-US|EN| In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
10k/wav/996.wav|EN-US|EN| The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
10k/wav/9965.wav|EN-US|EN| The king is delighted by the honor.
10k/wav/9974.wav|EN-US|EN| We should have been rewarded for producing.
10k/wav/9978.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been an extremely long call.
10k/wav/9997.wav|EN-US|EN| It would take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
10k/wav/10.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no proposals on the table.
10k/wav/100.wav|EN-US|EN| We wanted to replicate that success.
10k/wav/1006.wav|EN-US|EN| I cut dropped for that game.
10k/wav/101.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be very, very tight
10k/wav/1010.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't have the reply.
10k/wav/1020.wav|EN-US|EN| A review of the decision is being sought.
10k/wav/1022.wav|EN-US|EN| However, within those figures, income from my Versailles visitors increased.
10k/wav/1045.wav|EN-US|EN| It is much as it has been described.
10k/wav/1062.wav|EN-US|EN| I am going to see my friend.
10k/wav/1063.wav|EN-US|EN| I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
10k/wav/1082.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he was impressed by the setup by Celtic.
10k/wav/1093.wav|EN-US|EN| Movement has to take place.
10k/wav/1102.wav|EN-US|EN| That's what it's all about, isn't it?
10k/wav/1112.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps it should stay there.
10k/wav/1123.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we've got the balance right.
10k/wav/1142.wav|EN-US|EN| My life is in the ballet.
10k/wav/116.wav|EN-US|EN| I only half believe it.
10k/wav/1168.wav|EN-US|EN| And there is no cost for it.
10k/wav/1169.wav|EN-US|EN| People would say he thinks he can do that as well.
10k/wav/1188.wav|EN-US|EN| He dismissed the action.
10k/wav/120.wav|EN-US|EN| Today we must not repeat that mistake.
10k/wav/121.wav|EN-US|EN| Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
10k/wav/1211.wav|EN-US|EN| partisan can afford to be generous
10k/wav/1212.wav|EN-US|EN| Public safety is paramount.
10k/wav/1223.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a very interesting move.
10k/wav/1230.wav|EN-US|EN| I have never seen him like that.
10k/wav/1240.wav|EN-US|EN| Billy was yet to be born.
10k/wav/1247.wav|EN-US|EN| I would like to see the figures for the second quarter.
10k/wav/1251.wav|EN-US|EN| I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
10k/wav/1255.wav|EN-US|EN| Tell us about it.
10k/wav/1257.wav|EN-US|EN| that we must work in harmony.
10k/wav/1258.wav|EN-US|EN| It was nice to come back.
10k/wav/1261.wav|EN-US|EN| It is an important step forward.
10k/wav/1272.wav|EN-US|EN| It's hot, but we have had so much to do.
10k/wav/1321.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just glad that no one was hurt.
10k/wav/1327.wav|EN-US|EN| It does not even cover stuff shortage.
10k/wav/1333.wav|EN-US|EN| What are you supposed to do? Just walk away.
10k/wav/1365.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a deeply moving musical experience.
10k/wav/1375.wav|EN-US|EN| The rear of the plane was on fire.
10k/wav/1377.wav|EN-US|EN| Nast, we can beat them.
10k/wav/1384.wav|EN-US|EN| At first the youngster was not keen.
10k/wav/1387.wav|EN-US|EN| I believe it will happen.
10k/wav/139.wav|EN-US|EN| But the cost to this health was enormous.
10k/wav/1402.wav|EN-US|EN| The meat was euphoric.
10k/wav/1408.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a cry for help.
10k/wav/1411.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just in state of shock.
10k/wav/1418.wav|EN-US|EN| The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
10k/wav/142.wav|EN-US|EN| His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.
10k/wav/144.wav|EN-US|EN| It takes the biscuit.
10k/wav/1441.wav|EN-US|EN| The music industry hasn't changed at all.
10k/wav/1446.wav|EN-US|EN| The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god photo or heavy rain.
10k/wav/1460.wav|EN-US|EN| That never seemed likely.
10k/wav/1474.wav|EN-US|EN| Shenrit, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
10k/wav/1488.wav|EN-US|EN| They had saw that it all.
10k/wav/1517.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been a magical moment.
10k/wav/1519.wav|EN-US|EN| It's going to be tough.
10k/wav/1520.wav|EN-US|EN| I should not be able to stand.
10k/wav/153.wav|EN-US|EN| Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
10k/wav/1531.wav|EN-US|EN| There are no problems between us at all.
10k/wav/1536.wav|EN-US|EN| The waiting is over, well almost.
10k/wav/1541.wav|EN-US|EN| Its body language is all wrong.
10k/wav/1546.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a demand for it.
10k/wav/1555.wav|EN-US|EN| I think she's supreme.
10k/wav/1557.wav|EN-US|EN| But there was no time for that.
10k/wav/1561.wav|EN-US|EN| I fell against him.
10k/wav/1575.wav|EN-US|EN| This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
10k/wav/161.wav|EN-US|EN| Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
10k/wav/1619.wav|EN-US|EN| We must all play our part.
10k/wav/1622.wav|EN-US|EN| Did they give any good advice?
10k/wav/1628.wav|EN-US|EN| He must not be removed from office.
10k/wav/1630.wav|EN-US|EN| The penalties were given.
10k/wav/1632.wav|EN-US|EN| We'll have consequences for Scottish universities.
10k/wav/164.wav|EN-US|EN| We have not given up.
10k/wav/1652.wav|EN-US|EN| Nor is it likely to do so.
10k/wav/1655.wav|EN-US|EN| His background is family in venture capital.
10k/wav/169.wav|EN-US|EN| I was in jail for five years.
10k/wav/1695.wav|EN-US|EN| We were in different places, each one in size.
10k/wav/1698.wav|EN-US|EN| That's what happened to cut stair.
10k/wav/1720.wav|EN-US|EN| Let feet were the order of the day.
10k/wav/1736.wav|EN-US|EN| It's been very exciting, very challenging and a privilege.
10k/wav/1742.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no reported casualties on the ground.
10k/wav/1749.wav|EN-US|EN| I hope you had a caught time, to be honest.
10k/wav/1755.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a bit like a bathement.
10k/wav/1756.wav|EN-US|EN| I've always been very taken by the drink.
10k/wav/1779.wav|EN-US|EN| Its work includes tearing with shoulder piece.
10k/wav/180.wav|EN-US|EN| For some it was more painful than others.
10k/wav/1800.wav|EN-US|EN| They have not let anyone into the loop.
10k/wav/181.wav|EN-US|EN| My views on the decision are well known.
10k/wav/1816.wav|EN-US|EN| It was served by sheriff officers.
10k/wav/1834.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a friendly match.
10k/wav/1837.wav|EN-US|EN| How do you feel?
10k/wav/1842.wav|EN-US|EN| You could very well be.
10k/wav/1846.wav|EN-US|EN| Mrs. Taylor is taking legal advice.
10k/wav/1860.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not even thinking about that.
10k/wav/1861.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a Namaste.
10k/wav/1868.wav|EN-US|EN| The Scottish management team will settle for that.
10k/wav/1870.wav|EN-US|EN| I am going to win the gold
10k/wav/1889.wav|EN-US|EN| The future might well be green after all.

10k/wav/2062.wav|EN-US|EN| He is severe.
10k/wav/2079.wav|EN-US|EN| Finally came the moment of truth.
10k/wav/209.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be really interesting if they did.
10k/wav/2091.wav|EN-US|EN| But he's something special, is he not?
10k/wav/2100.wav|EN-US|EN| The Visual Arts Committee took this decision in December.
10k/wav/2126.wav|EN-US|EN| No, it wasn't supposed to do that. Official is admitted.

10k/wav/2136.wav|EN-US|EN| Fill back was a bit of thin then.

10k/wav/2200.wav|EN-US|EN| Bran also believes in walkers as innocents.

10k/wav/2518.wav|EN-US|EN| We had never seen him before.
10k/wav/2529.wav|EN-US|EN| Tyson is overwhelmed.
10k/wav/255.wav|EN-US|EN| Young people will always run away.
10k/wav/2555.wav|EN-US|EN| But that's another story.
10k/wav/2557.wav|EN-US|EN| All options are open.
10k/wav/2575.wav|EN-US|EN| I just had to go for it.
10k/wav/2576.wav|EN-US|EN| That is difficult to answer.
10k/wav/2578.wav|EN-US|EN| Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
10k/wav/2583.wav|EN-US|EN| It will be completed from the Nuer.
10k/wav/2588.wav|EN-US|EN| I had nothing to lose.
10k/wav/2592.wav|EN-US|EN| But who gave no details?
10k/wav/2595.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm sorry, but I forgot.
10k/wav/2624.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the highlight of my career.
10k/wav/2646.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
10k/wav/2650.wav|EN-US|EN| I would love to have him home.
10k/wav/2661.wav|EN-US|EN| I made a terrible start.
10k/wav/2677.wav|EN-US|EN| I have had a good life.
10k/wav/2680.wav|EN-US|EN| They were not consulted.
10k/wav/2696.wav|EN-US|EN| Do yourself a favor.
10k/wav/2697.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't actually believe them at first.
10k/wav/270.wav|EN-US|EN| So what's the shape and what's the detail?
10k/wav/2705.wav|EN-US|EN| Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
10k/wav/2716.wav|EN-US|EN| Next league matches Wotherwellston de United
10k/wav/2732.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not under any new pressure.
10k/wav/2733.wav|EN-US|EN| It gets into the culture.
10k/wav/2734.wav|EN-US|EN| Analysts at the offer was fair.
10k/wav/2745.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he had now returned to Scottish industry men's to law Macdonald.
10k/wav/276.wav|EN-US|EN| It was totally my fault.
10k/wav/2765.wav|EN-US|EN| I remembered that day well.
10k/wav/2774.wav|EN-US|EN| The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
10k/wav/2782.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot speak on behalf of the Arab.
10k/wav/2786.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone in Brighton is pride of this team.
10k/wav/2799.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to go home.
10k/wav/2810.wav|EN-US|EN| I was loving that little girl.
10k/wav/2814.wav|EN-US|EN| It will come alright.
10k/wav/2820.wav|EN-US|EN| Both sides will be aware of this.
10k/wav/2830.wav|EN-US|EN| This could be the case.
10k/wav/2844.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, there were the unlucky ones.
10k/wav/2853.wav|EN-US|EN| The stuff are as good as any stuff in the city.
10k/wav/2854.wav|EN-US|EN| Strikers like to go to the ground.
10k/wav/2869.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all up to the members.
10k/wav/2878.wav|EN-US|EN| They should try to get tickets.
10k/wav/2906.wav|EN-US|EN| We are committed to urgent action.
10k/wav/2913.wav|EN-US|EN| The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
10k/wav/292.wav|EN-US|EN| He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
10k/wav/2920.wav|EN-US|EN| We were beaten by the better team.
10k/wav/2928.wav|EN-US|EN| I gain from the pots.
10k/wav/2936.wav|EN-US|EN| We are now in a safe place.
10k/wav/296.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd be kept him in touch with everything.
10k/wav/2963.wav|EN-US|EN| The text is reduced to bubbles.
10k/wav/2967.wav|EN-US|EN| pupils and stuff were sent home early.
10k/wav/2969.wav|EN-US|EN| It's so awful.
10k/wav/2988.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel alive and good today.
10k/wav/2993.wav|EN-US|EN| He said a change in legislation was law mover due.
10k/wav/3001.wav|EN-US|EN| But every country has its own character.
10k/wav/3006.wav|EN-US|EN| Opera must catch its house in order.
10k/wav/3014.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully they will not go through with it.
10k/wav/3025.wav|EN-US|EN| I've been really looking forward to it.
10k/wav/3030.wav|EN-US|EN| I would like to focus on the structure and the target.
10k/wav/304.wav|EN-US|EN| He insisted that his staff were too.
10k/wav/3055.wav|EN-US|EN| It's like if he's alright, we will go with him.
10k/wav/3077.wav|EN-US|EN| I should be doing that for her.
10k/wav/3078.wav|EN-US|EN| His potty was never found.
10k/wav/3080.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
10k/wav/3081.wav|EN-US|EN| We are already under pressure.
10k/wav/3089.wav|EN-US|EN| It all happens so quickly.
10k/wav/3094.wav|EN-US|EN| A board of inquiry has already been convened.
10k/wav/3100.wav|EN-US|EN| His rivals has pick him with yon.
10k/wav/3102.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps that was their mistake.
10k/wav/311.wav|EN-US|EN| That was quite an interesting part.
10k/wav/3128.wav|EN-US|EN| It will affect their work.
10k/wav/3158.wav|EN-US|EN| The president took offense.
10k/wav/316.wav|EN-US|EN| It makes a huge difference.
10k/wav/3195.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a milestone in the modernist vision of the Scottish Prosecution Suffers.
10k/wav/3218.wav|EN-US|EN| The proposal was rejected.
10k/wav/3224.wav|EN-US|EN| Our position is clear.
10k/wav/3231.wav|EN-US|EN| The claim was denied by First Minister.
10k/wav/3232.wav|EN-US|EN| Boarding school was equally protective.
10k/wav/3256.wav|EN-US|EN| The power will meet again in Glasgow and then train together in Australia.
10k/wav/3259.wav|EN-US|EN| I am going to miss it.
10k/wav/3265.wav|EN-US|EN| It became a national network.
10k/wav/3270.wav|EN-US|EN| The Institute port will take the decision.
10k/wav/3275.wav|EN-US|EN| Scott and Neet to work on two key areas
10k/wav/3289.wav|EN-US|EN| Fishing is a declining industry.
10k/wav/3318.wav|EN-US|EN| There will be no disruption in the schools.
10k/wav/3328.wav|EN-US|EN| It is dangerous and it is a lie.
10k/wav/3358.wav|EN-US|EN| He will need that machine.
10k/wav/3366.wav|EN-US|EN| I just want to know where that one came from.
10k/wav/3371.wav|EN-US|EN| This meeting is the path to salvation.
10k/wav/3391.wav|EN-US|EN| The whole thing has been a nightmare.
10k/wav/3392.wav|EN-US|EN| He can be beaten.
10k/wav/3398.wav|EN-US|EN| He claimed the government had lost the plot.
10k/wav/3408.wav|EN-US|EN| I really hope he thinks that's through.
10k/wav/3409.wav|EN-US|EN| You saw the photo pool.
10k/wav/341.wav|EN-US|EN| It is another big brother.
10k/wav/3422.wav|EN-US|EN| No other job in world football can compare to this one.
10k/wav/3424.wav|EN-US|EN| There is room for me.
10k/wav/3433.wav|EN-US|EN| Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
10k/wav/3436.wav|EN-US|EN| What other retailer would do this?
10k/wav/3447.wav|EN-US|EN| She died a few days later.
10k/wav/3448.wav|EN-US|EN| Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
10k/wav/347.wav|EN-US|EN| The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
10k/wav/3472.wav|EN-US|EN| The region is open for business.
10k/wav/3477.wav|EN-US|EN| The loss is heartbreaking.
10k/wav/3479.wav|EN-US|EN| That's my dot acting.
10k/wav/3480.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no immediate reports of injuries.
10k/wav/3486.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all to do with the coaching.
10k/wav/3498.wav|EN-US|EN| We don't have a solution to the problem.
10k/wav/3501.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
10k/wav/3507.wav|EN-US|EN| Four of the victims were women.
10k/wav/3517.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm just doing artwork.
10k/wav/3519.wav|EN-US|EN| I haven't been able to do it since.
10k/wav/3526.wav|EN-US|EN| if we get the wrong candidate.
10k/wav/3534.wav|EN-US|EN| What is the Parnet formula?
10k/wav/3544.wav|EN-US|EN| Some days are different from others.
10k/wav/3548.wav|EN-US|EN| Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
10k/wav/3564.wav|EN-US|EN| Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
10k/wav/3570.wav|EN-US|EN| But it couldn't happen overnight.
10k/wav/3578.wav|EN-US|EN| Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
10k/wav/3591.wav|EN-US|EN| I've got a sense of humility.
10k/wav/3601.wav|EN-US|EN| Rangers must be winners, it says.
10k/wav/3603.wav|EN-US|EN| They've just got to believe in themselves.
10k/wav/3611.wav|EN-US|EN| I've learnt a lot and tomorrow is another day.
10k/wav/362.wav|EN-US|EN| It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
10k/wav/3637.wav|EN-US|EN| This is slightly negative for inflation.
10k/wav/3641.wav|EN-US|EN| It does not take much.
10k/wav/365.wav|EN-US|EN| That gave us some confidence.
10k/wav/3653.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be the end of farming.
10k/wav/3662.wav|EN-US|EN| They thought they couldn't get any.
10k/wav/3677.wav|EN-US|EN| I will just have to be patient.
10k/wav/3688.wav|EN-US|EN| Greymores Propet
10k/wav/3692.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
10k/wav/3700.wav|EN-US|EN| I've had a very long one
10k/wav/3718.wav|EN-US|EN| He occused the Prime Minister of Devonne.
10k/wav/372.wav|EN-US|EN| It was de novo.
10k/wav/3724.wav|EN-US|EN| Twaddly is a case in point.
10k/wav/3725.wav|EN-US|EN| We will learn lessons from what has happened.
10k/wav/3726.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a big departure.
10k/wav/3727.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going to go about our lives.
10k/wav/3733.wav|EN-US|EN| I was not about to hate him.
10k/wav/3745.wav|EN-US|EN| But something has been lost in the translation.
10k/wav/3747.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the concern to me.
10k/wav/3752.wav|EN-US|EN| He saw long-term investments.
10k/wav/3753.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to work so hard.
10k/wav/3758.wav|EN-US|EN| They are only interested in attacking Labour.
10k/wav/3763.wav|EN-US|EN| We will try to find someone.
10k/wav/3777.wav|EN-US|EN| However, Hamilton had a different version of events.
10k/wav/3783.wav|EN-US|EN| We dumped another scale of neat.
10k/wav/3790.wav|EN-US|EN| The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods pass from earth to their home in the sky.
10k/wav/3792.wav|EN-US|EN| She had black eyes.
10k/wav/382.wav|EN-US|EN| No decisions have been made in this respect.
10k/wav/3825.wav|EN-US|EN| This is our first senior Scottish selection.
10k/wav/3832.wav|EN-US|EN| And you know something?
10k/wav/3851.wav|EN-US|EN| Crake is a major consent for us.
10k/wav/3862.wav|EN-US|EN| We have very limited capacity.
10k/wav/3866.wav|EN-US|EN| Take it like it was.
10k/wav/3872.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not a threat.
10k/wav/388.wav|EN-US|EN| However, we will have to wait and see.
10k/wav/3884.wav|EN-US|EN| The time is up for rock to comply.
10k/wav/3889.wav|EN-US|EN| No, they have not.
10k/wav/3908.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very pleased about the verdict.
10k/wav/3927.wav|EN-US|EN| That time is not far away.
10k/wav/3937.wav|EN-US|EN| But the fans deserve to know.
10k/wav/3941.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't think the action was a mistake.
10k/wav/3959.wav|EN-US|EN| It was mayhem.
10k/wav/3968.wav|EN-US|EN| That was not due to me.
10k/wav/3970.wav|EN-US|EN| It will probably be my last two.
10k/wav/3974.wav|EN-US|EN| Could they perhaps be related?
10k/wav/3980.wav|EN-US|EN| It was ignored.
10k/wav/3983.wav|EN-US|EN| We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
10k/wav/3999.wav|EN-US|EN| Will businesses continue to trade?
10k/wav/4015.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there would be no permanent displays.
10k/wav/4025.wav|EN-US|EN| John Lennon is a very large industry.
10k/wav/4027.wav|EN-US|EN| He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
10k/wav/403.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been going for three years.
10k/wav/4053.wav|EN-US|EN| He is not alone.
10k/wav/4054.wav|EN-US|EN| We still don't know what's happened.
10k/wav/4060.wav|EN-US|EN| It's Tony Blair on drugs.
10k/wav/4063.wav|EN-US|EN| Milani was asked.
10k/wav/4072.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm baguette endorsed.
10k/wav/4079.wav|EN-US|EN| We may need to take some very radical measures.
10k/wav/4089.wav|EN-US|EN| This could be a mistake.
10k/wav/4109.wav|EN-US|EN| Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
10k/wav/4114.wav|EN-US|EN| Last week he was taken to the hospital.
10k/wav/4119.wav|EN-US|EN| We are also looking for new licenses.
10k/wav/413.wav|EN-US|EN| Is there anything in the wand?
10k/wav/4140.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm extremely sad.
10k/wav/4143.wav|EN-US|EN| Brayton's role was to stop it.
10k/wav/4162.wav|EN-US|EN| I know we ask a lot of you.
10k/wav/4177.wav|EN-US|EN| We are worried about casualties.
10k/wav/4178.wav|EN-US|EN| But the main issue will be the sale of bugger king.
10k/wav/418.wav|EN-US|EN| A treasury specksman derided the toy charge.
10k/wav/4187.wav|EN-US|EN| Tax is a matter for national governments.
10k/wav/4199.wav|EN-US|EN| Others are expected to fall with the light
10k/wav/42.wav|EN-US|EN| Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
10k/wav/422.wav|EN-US|EN| We suggest to family working hot, working seven days a week.
10k/wav/4220.wav|EN-US|EN| I put pressure on him.
10k/wav/4240.wav|EN-US|EN| and he is immensely low
10k/wav/4247.wav|EN-US|EN| I've already done that
10k/wav/4258.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no common grant.
10k/wav/4270.wav|EN-US|EN| No finals are to be contested today.
10k/wav/4279.wav|EN-US|EN| That wasn't for me.
10k/wav/4282.wav|EN-US|EN| But sometimes it works out alright.
10k/wav/4291.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a privilege to work for him.
10k/wav/4294.wav|EN-US|EN| They're not going to get hurt.
10k/wav/4297.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a Scottish problem.
10k/wav/4298.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we were going to make it.
10k/wav/4308.wav|EN-US|EN| But he is reveling in the big stage.
10k/wav/4309.wav|EN-US|EN| We were given a warm and friendly reception.
10k/wav/4311.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt we needed to bring that in.
10k/wav/4317.wav|EN-US|EN| Maybe it will work though.
10k/wav/4325.wav|EN-US|EN| Survival is not an option.
10k/wav/433.wav|EN-US|EN| Neo has reputed to have replied.
10k/wav/4330.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a very special city.
10k/wav/4332.wav|EN-US|EN| The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
10k/wav/4337.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not one for the purest.
10k/wav/4350.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course, it doesn't all come off.
10k/wav/4355.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to create events
10k/wav/4395.wav|EN-US|EN| This kind of problem wises everywhere.
10k/wav/4410.wav|EN-US|EN| I see social work as a vacation commitment.
10k/wav/4417.wav|EN-US|EN| It was electric. Amazing.
10k/wav/4431.wav|EN-US|EN| We had a huge response to that campaign.
10k/wav/4433.wav|EN-US|EN| Each case is treated unburied.
10k/wav/4438.wav|EN-US|EN| Lothian and Border's Peace are appealing for witnesses.
10k/wav/4445.wav|EN-US|EN| But no decision has been made.
10k/wav/4447.wav|EN-US|EN| The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
10k/wav/445.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland needs to hear it too.
10k/wav/4453.wav|EN-US|EN| How can they tell?
10k/wav/4467.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
10k/wav/447.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an internal matter.
10k/wav/4475.wav|EN-US|EN| I saw military vehicles in the distance.
10k/wav/4478.wav|EN-US|EN| The Hill family was in shock.
10k/wav/4482.wav|EN-US|EN| Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
10k/wav/4490.wav|EN-US|EN| The court's record was in his name.
10k/wav/4495.wav|EN-US|EN| They are very concerned and you can understand that
10k/wav/4514.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
10k/wav/4523.wav|EN-US|EN| Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
10k/wav/453.wav|EN-US|EN| We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.
10k/wav/4537.wav|EN-US|EN| It's unfair on her.
10k/wav/4538.wav|EN-US|EN| I chose to go by the rules.
10k/wav/4542.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a symbolic concert.
10k/wav/4547.wav|EN-US|EN| Three others were wounded.
10k/wav/4565.wav|EN-US|EN| The entries are not too serious.
10k/wav/4574.wav|EN-US|EN| It is time to come into the limelight.
10k/wav/4578.wav|EN-US|EN| They were back in further training yesterday.
10k/wav/4579.wav|EN-US|EN| But the town has great potential as a book town.
10k/wav/4580.wav|EN-US|EN| And there are some interesting conductors too.
10k/wav/4589.wav|EN-US|EN| There were a lot of emotions.
10k/wav/4595.wav|EN-US|EN| We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
10k/wav/4615.wav|EN-US|EN| I behind the stuff about the markets
10k/wav/463.wav|EN-US|EN| It is also claimed that he was murdered.
10k/wav/4639.wav|EN-US|EN| The people are nice, though.
10k/wav/4642.wav|EN-US|EN| So what could be better than becoming captain?
10k/wav/4659.wav|EN-US|EN| Exocasity was a wonderful experience.
10k/wav/4669.wav|EN-US|EN| Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
10k/wav/4673.wav|EN-US|EN| Why cause spitting on the bro face?
10k/wav/4682.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, it isn't related to the
10k/wav/4691.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, it is not to be.
10k/wav/4693.wav|EN-US|EN| I cannot believe something like this could happen.
10k/wav/470.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an idea.
10k/wav/4706.wav|EN-US|EN| It is hard to understand.
10k/wav/472.wav|EN-US|EN| This was a chilling echo.
10k/wav/4735.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not concerned with protection of the public.
10k/wav/4744.wav|EN-US|EN| Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
10k/wav/4753.wav|EN-US|EN| He knows what he's got to do.
10k/wav/4786.wav|EN-US|EN| We are now setting about finding them.
10k/wav/4787.wav|EN-US|EN| Well some thought that they have.
10k/wav/4824.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is being perceived.
10k/wav/483.wav|EN-US|EN| We had to laugh.
10k/wav/4850.wav|EN-US|EN| This will save interest charges.
10k/wav/4881.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a simple question.
10k/wav/4885.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a good start.
10k/wav/4901.wav|EN-US|EN| So many people will be affected by this.
10k/wav/4905.wav|EN-US|EN| He was not deterred.
10k/wav/4912.wav|EN-US|EN| It also opened a branch in Livingston.
10k/wav/4913.wav|EN-US|EN| He confirmed his fitness.
10k/wav/493.wav|EN-US|EN| Although it was expected, everyone is very very angry.
10k/wav/4941.wav|EN-US|EN| We made a world record together.
10k/wav/4946.wav|EN-US|EN| Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
10k/wav/4954.wav|EN-US|EN| This must be kept in total perspective.
10k/wav/496.wav|EN-US|EN| Sounds like the sixth sense.
10k/wav/4974.wav|EN-US|EN| Do not imagine for a moment that they are not they.
10k/wav/4981.wav|EN-US|EN| I do not see it as some kind of reward.
10k/wav/499.wav|EN-US|EN| How do you respond to losing your chart?
10k/wav/4994.wav|EN-US|EN| The family also declined to discuss the case.
10k/wav/4998.wav|EN-US|EN| My grandparents were terrified.
10k/wav/5008.wav|EN-US|EN| There was seriously after him
10k/wav/5020.wav|EN-US|EN| It was good to score the goal today.
10k/wav/5023.wav|EN-US|EN| until they came to do it.
10k/wav/5059.wav|EN-US|EN| We will have to look in the mirror.
10k/wav/5064.wav|EN-US|EN| That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
10k/wav/5066.wav|EN-US|EN| It must be tough to live with.
10k/wav/5076.wav|EN-US|EN| The government agreed to pay.
10k/wav/5095.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm only looking forward to it.
10k/wav/5097.wav|EN-US|EN| I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
10k/wav/5098.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not as simple as that.
10k/wav/5100.wav|EN-US|EN| Then fill it up out of flue.
10k/wav/5104.wav|EN-US|EN| and it has been a marvellous occasion
10k/wav/5110.wav|EN-US|EN| I think we can get there.
10k/wav/5113.wav|EN-US|EN| the weather effect of the other two games in Fife.
10k/wav/5122.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very pleased for the club and for myself.
10k/wav/5144.wav|EN-US|EN| She started to pit on mate.
10k/wav/515.wav|EN-US|EN| Other villages were completely deserted.
10k/wav/5153.wav|EN-US|EN| World away from Rangers, you might say.
10k/wav/5159.wav|EN-US|EN| I haven't got there yet.
10k/wav/5160.wav|EN-US|EN| It was quite rigorous.
10k/wav/5163.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
10k/wav/5165.wav|EN-US|EN| You are a gambling man.
10k/wav/5201.wav|EN-US|EN| We are both very confused and extremely angry.
10k/wav/5207.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the last week of rehearsals.
10k/wav/5211.wav|EN-US|EN| I see no need for change.
10k/wav/5212.wav|EN-US|EN| This is still a young team, you know.
10k/wav/5213.wav|EN-US|EN| The atmosphere was excellent.
10k/wav/5219.wav|EN-US|EN| Shatirasan.
10k/wav/5229.wav|EN-US|EN| It depends on the couple.
10k/wav/5232.wav|EN-US|EN| But there was a heavy price to pay.
10k/wav/5239.wav|EN-US|EN| I lost my heart.
10k/wav/5240.wav|EN-US|EN| It went on forever.
10k/wav/525.wav|EN-US|EN| Did you trip?
10k/wav/5257.wav|EN-US|EN| It was very well received.
10k/wav/5266.wav|EN-US|EN| Do they think anyone else wants them?
10k/wav/5272.wav|EN-US|EN| We could not get any possession.
10k/wav/529.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not a European army.
10k/wav/5299.wav|EN-US|EN| He then did just that.
10k/wav/5303.wav|EN-US|EN| Worse still, it can be infectious.
10k/wav/5305.wav|EN-US|EN| Next league marches Celtic
10k/wav/5316.wav|EN-US|EN| The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
10k/wav/5317.wav|EN-US|EN| That is our meaning.
10k/wav/5322.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a similar story for milk and dough products.
10k/wav/5340.wav|EN-US|EN| No one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
10k/wav/5346.wav|EN-US|EN| He will address the nation this evening.
10k/wav/5354.wav|EN-US|EN| It was ugly.
10k/wav/5356.wav|EN-US|EN| Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
10k/wav/5357.wav|EN-US|EN| The stuff are very good.
10k/wav/5359.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there could be more bad weather to come
10k/wav/5374.wav|EN-US|EN| She is a double effector.
10k/wav/5377.wav|EN-US|EN| This is purely financial.
10k/wav/5378.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's not the end of Scottish football.
10k/wav/5388.wav|EN-US|EN| I found that much more challenging.
10k/wav/54.wav|EN-US|EN| We have her hopes that this will work.
10k/wav/5402.wav|EN-US|EN| I have totally had enough.
10k/wav/5408.wav|EN-US|EN| Trevor has been great.
10k/wav/5410.wav|EN-US|EN| I am looking forward to phasing the Ojman.
10k/wav/5411.wav|EN-US|EN| So it was in politics.
10k/wav/542.wav|EN-US|EN| Show, it's funny.
10k/wav/5420.wav|EN-US|EN| But when we do it is great.
10k/wav/5423.wav|EN-US|EN| We were delighted and we certainly deserved it.
10k/wav/5424.wav|EN-US|EN| He did it well.
10k/wav/5431.wav|EN-US|EN| I came here this week to work
10k/wav/5440.wav|EN-US|EN| I was so proud of my team.
10k/wav/5444.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
10k/wav/545.wav|EN-US|EN| The group is not paying the dividend.
10k/wav/5456.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not fair.
10k/wav/5458.wav|EN-US|EN| He has a wealth of experience.
10k/wav/5465.wav|EN-US|EN| They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
10k/wav/5469.wav|EN-US|EN| They have failed to deliver.
10k/wav/5478.wav|EN-US|EN| I've even got three other ideas for the day.
10k/wav/5479.wav|EN-US|EN| A recording contract is on the horizon.
10k/wav/5484.wav|EN-US|EN| I decided not to renew the contract.
10k/wav/5495.wav|EN-US|EN| I can just sins to keep on improving.
10k/wav/550.wav|EN-US|EN| The offer of help is there for anyone.
10k/wav/5523.wav|EN-US|EN| I knew you would play two weeks ago.
10k/wav/5532.wav|EN-US|EN| Then is suddenly, they weren't.
10k/wav/5533.wav|EN-US|EN| That was a great performance by the team.
10k/wav/5549.wav|EN-US|EN| We know we have done more.
10k/wav/5552.wav|EN-US|EN| By that time, however, it was already too late
10k/wav/558.wav|EN-US|EN| The projections are very positive for South Africa.
10k/wav/5581.wav|EN-US|EN| The claim was denied by the First Minister.
10k/wav/5588.wav|EN-US|EN| Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
10k/wav/5590.wav|EN-US|EN| But could it afford to run it?
10k/wav/5597.wav|EN-US|EN| Mary is as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
10k/wav/5637.wav|EN-US|EN| That's the last thing they need.
10k/wav/5641.wav|EN-US|EN| It's difficult to predict the future.
10k/wav/5642.wav|EN-US|EN| There's nothing for you here.
10k/wav/5645.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the best place.
10k/wav/5651.wav|EN-US|EN| He may be ready for first team action in March.
10k/wav/5656.wav|EN-US|EN| There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
10k/wav/5671.wav|EN-US|EN| When she returned it was a wreck.
10k/wav/5680.wav|EN-US|EN| It comes on like a tidal wave.
10k/wav/5695.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't feel like working.
10k/wav/5700.wav|EN-US|EN| But the championship is not over yet.
10k/wav/5705.wav|EN-US|EN| You are looking at specialist stuff and specialist stuff costs money
10k/wav/5712.wav|EN-US|EN| But this was into the film picture.
10k/wav/5721.wav|EN-US|EN| We regret that they were brought in the first place.
10k/wav/5753.wav|EN-US|EN| She makes me so happy.
10k/wav/5755.wav|EN-US|EN| I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.
10k/wav/576.wav|EN-US|EN| That's how he did the damage.
10k/wav/5764.wav|EN-US|EN| Had I hurt?
10k/wav/5765.wav|EN-US|EN| Then they were awarded a penalty.
10k/wav/5777.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't honestly know how to describe it.
10k/wav/5800.wav|EN-US|EN| Last night she refused to comment on the accident.
10k/wav/5804.wav|EN-US|EN| We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
10k/wav/5836.wav|EN-US|EN| I have got a victim.
10k/wav/5847.wav|EN-US|EN| He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
10k/wav/5857.wav|EN-US|EN| They didn't have a care in the world.
10k/wav/5873.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Marshall is expected to join the Council of Europe.
10k/wav/5875.wav|EN-US|EN| I do love the chance to play for Scotland.
10k/wav/5878.wav|EN-US|EN| His second was a beauty.
10k/wav/5881.wav|EN-US|EN| The task is enormous.
10k/wav/5889.wav|EN-US|EN| The problem is the pitch.
10k/wav/5903.wav|EN-US|EN| I was later, she was found dead by Ms Walson.
10k/wav/5906.wav|EN-US|EN| The woman is basically off a hut.
10k/wav/5910.wav|EN-US|EN| And that is not a bad idea.
10k/wav/5919.wav|EN-US|EN| But there's the nip-turn in the sector.
10k/wav/5920.wav|EN-US|EN| It truly was my favourite.
10k/wav/5927.wav|EN-US|EN| I can confirm that Ms. Deakin has received a proton infone call.
10k/wav/5929.wav|EN-US|EN| He is still in shock.
10k/wav/5934.wav|EN-US|EN| This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
10k/wav/5955.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been very stupid.
10k/wav/5963.wav|EN-US|EN| I let go the telephone and ran.
10k/wav/5969.wav|EN-US|EN| It was good fun.
10k/wav/5972.wav|EN-US|EN| We are not prepared to do that.
10k/wav/5974.wav|EN-US|EN| Would it be good for the nation widely?
10k/wav/5986.wav|EN-US|EN| We have worked well with them for years.
10k/wav/5995.wav|EN-US|EN| He was to get his chance.
10k/wav/6015.wav|EN-US|EN| It comes from reflection or thinking.
10k/wav/6026.wav|EN-US|EN| That is goodness.
10k/wav/6027.wav|EN-US|EN| The police believe the man was not injured.
10k/wav/6028.wav|EN-US|EN| This is not quite right.
10k/wav/6030.wav|EN-US|EN| It was one of those things.
10k/wav/6037.wav|EN-US|EN| An announcement is expected soon.
10k/wav/6047.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't want to know how she does it.
10k/wav/6066.wav|EN-US|EN| The approval of system will be changed.
10k/wav/607.wav|EN-US|EN| Is that success?
10k/wav/6092.wav|EN-US|EN| The parties include the Scottish Executive.
10k/wav/6104.wav|EN-US|EN| Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
10k/wav/6108.wav|EN-US|EN| I ran to get out of the way.
10k/wav/6118.wav|EN-US|EN| He was determined to write a novel.
10k/wav/6121.wav|EN-US|EN| workb has an extended run
10k/wav/6139.wav|EN-US|EN| Sean Coney did not disappoint.
10k/wav/6146.wav|EN-US|EN| It has come a long way since then
10k/wav/6153.wav|EN-US|EN| It opened last month.
10k/wav/6162.wav|EN-US|EN| They are not going away.
10k/wav/6170.wav|EN-US|EN| It did my image a lot of cut.
10k/wav/6187.wav|EN-US|EN| In 10 items, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
10k/wav/6190.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an adventure.
10k/wav/6191.wav|EN-US|EN| The last Felix have been really bad.
10k/wav/6192.wav|EN-US|EN| In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
10k/wav/6195.wav|EN-US|EN| It's good fun and makes it so much more interesting.
10k/wav/6198.wav|EN-US|EN| That is our business.
10k/wav/6199.wav|EN-US|EN| However, he added there were signs of progress.
10k/wav/620.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing like this has ever happened to you before.
10k/wav/6204.wav|EN-US|EN| What will happen to them today?
10k/wav/6208.wav|EN-US|EN| It should be easy.
10k/wav/6227.wav|EN-US|EN| A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
10k/wav/623.wav|EN-US|EN| Thankfully there were no reports of anything serious.
10k/wav/6233.wav|EN-US|EN| What does he go from there?
10k/wav/6240.wav|EN-US|EN| The null was revealed.
10k/wav/6244.wav|EN-US|EN| You have a very persuasive precedent.
10k/wav/6247.wav|EN-US|EN| It seems to have worked.
10k/wav/6250.wav|EN-US|EN| We should be able to cope.
10k/wav/627.wav|EN-US|EN| He liked the weather, the courses, the fit.
10k/wav/6275.wav|EN-US|EN| Scotland will not bid for new labour next time.
10k/wav/6287.wav|EN-US|EN| You have made your put.
10k/wav/6292.wav|EN-US|EN| That ignorance is crucial.
10k/wav/6294.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm proud of my team.
10k/wav/6299.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a long way to go
10k/wav/630.wav|EN-US|EN| Business will continue as usual.
10k/wav/6306.wav|EN-US|EN| I've got to be pleased with that.
10k/wav/6307.wav|EN-US|EN| Edinburgh present will also require to be seen.
10k/wav/6312.wav|EN-US|EN| I felt like I was a child.
10k/wav/6321.wav|EN-US|EN| Father is on the train.
10k/wav/6382.wav|EN-US|EN| The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
10k/wav/6391.wav|EN-US|EN| This is equally relevant to the landowner.
10k/wav/6402.wav|EN-US|EN| After all, this is the start of the Giving H.
10k/wav/6403.wav|EN-US|EN| Tickets will be at a premium.
10k/wav/6404.wav|EN-US|EN| Or they, you never know.
10k/wav/6408.wav|EN-US|EN| Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
10k/wav/6409.wav|EN-US|EN| Succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
10k/wav/6425.wav|EN-US|EN| The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
10k/wav/644.wav|EN-US|EN| That argument has been won.
10k/wav/6446.wav|EN-US|EN| Two other men, including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
10k/wav/6448.wav|EN-US|EN| We might never see him again.
10k/wav/6463.wav|EN-US|EN| However, it is much bigger than that
10k/wav/6469.wav|EN-US|EN| It's very difficult and very weighing.
10k/wav/6484.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a good atmosphere.
10k/wav/6495.wav|EN-US|EN| The cost of this failure will not take the commission.
10k/wav/6499.wav|EN-US|EN| It is not over by any means.
10k/wav/6506.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been a waste of time.
10k/wav/6514.wav|EN-US|EN| I was just getting over the time difference.
10k/wav/6549.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no evidence against him.
10k/wav/6552.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing is going right at the moment.
10k/wav/6564.wav|EN-US|EN| He was extremely ill.
10k/wav/6575.wav|EN-US|EN| The state is controlled by the left.
10k/wav/6582.wav|EN-US|EN| I couldn't honestly tell you.
10k/wav/6585.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very realistic about these things.
10k/wav/6603.wav|EN-US|EN| I never made any offer to Mark.
10k/wav/6605.wav|EN-US|EN| However, we led them back into the cane.
10k/wav/6616.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm not ready to work for me.
10k/wav/6628.wav|EN-US|EN| That was my mistake.
10k/wav/6638.wav|EN-US|EN| Family liaison officers are networking to support the family.
10k/wav/6657.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an old story.
10k/wav/6658.wav|EN-US|EN| Just get on with it.
10k/wav/6666.wav|EN-US|EN| I would never say anything against her.
10k/wav/6668.wav|EN-US|EN| I will just have to live with that.
10k/wav/6688.wav|EN-US|EN| He was replaced by John Spencer.
10k/wav/6689.wav|EN-US|EN| That was the initial attraction.
10k/wav/6701.wav|EN-US|EN| They are the innocent victims.
10k/wav/6706.wav|EN-US|EN| Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
10k/wav/6721.wav|EN-US|EN| We lost our composure towards the intervals he said.
10k/wav/6729.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a creative energy.
10k/wav/6735.wav|EN-US|EN| It have well and investors and people would.
10k/wav/6752.wav|EN-US|EN| No date has been set for the appeal.
10k/wav/6759.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm still waiting for a reply
10k/wav/6761.wav|EN-US|EN| He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
10k/wav/677.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a lot of anchor
10k/wav/6775.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm considered a teenager.
10k/wav/6786.wav|EN-US|EN| We will have to think about it.
10k/wav/6794.wav|EN-US|EN| I try not to expect anything.
10k/wav/6795.wav|EN-US|EN| Trading is tough at the moment
10k/wav/6803.wav|EN-US|EN| It's better to be happy.
10k/wav/6804.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a very, very special day
10k/wav/6805.wav|EN-US|EN| It is understood that a muskail for the refurbishment has slipped.
10k/wav/6808.wav|EN-US|EN| Today she has been released.
10k/wav/6815.wav|EN-US|EN| Nighty is trying to downgrade the media.
10k/wav/6819.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not a swimming pool out there.
10k/wav/6898.wav|EN-US|EN| And the World Cup has not even begun.
10k/wav/6899.wav|EN-US|EN| Who wants to be a Malino?
10k/wav/6901.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's been kept to minimum.
10k/wav/6914.wav|EN-US|EN| That is why this action has been taken.
10k/wav/6922.wav|EN-US|EN| It is the last meeting of the season.
10k/wav/6938.wav|EN-US|EN| The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
10k/wav/6943.wav|EN-US|EN| We can't win a big game.
10k/wav/6946.wav|EN-US|EN| It's an absolute nonsense.
10k/wav/6963.wav|EN-US|EN| It would be a last resort.
10k/wav/7009.wav|EN-US|EN| The money needs to go to the front own.
10k/wav/7011.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a dangerous spot.
10k/wav/703.wav|EN-US|EN| We have go up in Brighton.
10k/wav/7034.wav|EN-US|EN| I feel really confident in that department.
10k/wav/7068.wav|EN-US|EN| There were no reported injuries.
10k/wav/7094.wav|EN-US|EN| If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere
10k/wav/7105.wav|EN-US|EN| It's lost but difficult. It really isn't.
10k/wav/7107.wav|EN-US|EN| He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.
10k/wav/7118.wav|EN-US|EN| It's hard to make these decisions at Marge.
10k/wav/7143.wav|EN-US|EN| He will feel the pain again.
10k/wav/716.wav|EN-US|EN| Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
10k/wav/7165.wav|EN-US|EN| Advice and counselling will be offered.
10k/wav/7181.wav|EN-US|EN| These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
10k/wav/7188.wav|EN-US|EN| It is difficult to say.
10k/wav/7192.wav|EN-US|EN| It is sometimes like that.
10k/wav/7210.wav|EN-US|EN| It will never happen.
10k/wav/7211.wav|EN-US|EN| The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
10k/wav/7226.wav|EN-US|EN| We have been extremely busy.
10k/wav/7229.wav|EN-US|EN| I am astonished at your tack.
10k/wav/7244.wav|EN-US|EN| He nearly killed my son.
10k/wav/7253.wav|EN-US|EN| It is bad news for the flooded areas.
10k/wav/7279.wav|EN-US|EN| If that is not a warning, what is it?
10k/wav/7282.wav|EN-US|EN| The villages were shot in the Haidat short range.
10k/wav/7290.wav|EN-US|EN| Nothing else would do.
10k/wav/7302.wav|EN-US|EN| The attitude and commitment was decent.
10k/wav/7313.wav|EN-US|EN| Strathclyde Peace are expected to make an announcement next month.
10k/wav/7317.wav|EN-US|EN| But the plot is not the point.
10k/wav/7336.wav|EN-US|EN| They have to be dealt with.
10k/wav/7340.wav|EN-US|EN| It has not yet opened to pupils.
10k/wav/7350.wav|EN-US|EN| I came home by influence.
10k/wav/7352.wav|EN-US|EN| Something happened on that island.
10k/wav/7360.wav|EN-US|EN| That suggests that outfitness is good.
10k/wav/7363.wav|EN-US|EN| iPod is clearly capable.
10k/wav/7364.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a total disaster.
10k/wav/7373.wav|EN-US|EN| There is great relief at this point.
10k/wav/7383.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue. It's nice to hear.
10k/wav/7403.wav|EN-US|EN| He made no comment.
10k/wav/7409.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a crucial moment.
10k/wav/7428.wav|EN-US|EN| That will not change.
10k/wav/7432.wav|EN-US|EN| But at the moment there isn't the budget.
10k/wav/7435.wav|EN-US|EN| We did not even get a free kick.
10k/wav/7436.wav|EN-US|EN| That is my personal view.
10k/wav/7439.wav|EN-US|EN| Also everyone believed.
10k/wav/744.wav|EN-US|EN| Next week marches, Dundee United, Motherwell
10k/wav/7447.wav|EN-US|EN| We decided we would go for a specialist in site centre.
10k/wav/7496.wav|EN-US|EN| Vic 2 was never in doubt.
10k/wav/7511.wav|EN-US|EN| There is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
10k/wav/7520.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
10k/wav/7522.wav|EN-US|EN| Now we have for our shape.
10k/wav/7525.wav|EN-US|EN| We were given a break.
10k/wav/7537.wav|EN-US|EN| But it is looking very positive.
10k/wav/7547.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to be frank.
10k/wav/7574.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't need to watch it on the video.
10k/wav/7575.wav|EN-US|EN| Our political persuasion is no secret.
10k/wav/7580.wav|EN-US|EN| They were just a good retailer
10k/wav/7585.wav|EN-US|EN| We will provide immediate access.
10k/wav/7589.wav|EN-US|EN| Thompson is expected to manage the business.
10k/wav/7597.wav|EN-US|EN| Angelix Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
10k/wav/7604.wav|EN-US|EN| I've done it almost like a variety show.
10k/wav/761.wav|EN-US|EN| The time for change is now.
10k/wav/7616.wav|EN-US|EN| I can't believe it happened.
10k/wav/7653.wav|EN-US|EN| The contest was already over.
10k/wav/7657.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, it was certainly different
10k/wav/7664.wav|EN-US|EN| And that started me thinking.
10k/wav/7670.wav|EN-US|EN| I had some time with Aston Villa.
10k/wav/7675.wav|EN-US|EN| and is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
10k/wav/7689.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a personal decision for me.
10k/wav/7703.wav|EN-US|EN| The acting asked a lot to be desired.
10k/wav/7704.wav|EN-US|EN| That would be best for him.
10k/wav/7723.wav|EN-US|EN| I thought it was a fantastic game.
10k/wav/7739.wav|EN-US|EN| We had no idea that this lighter existed.
10k/wav/7761.wav|EN-US|EN| It's to do with play.
10k/wav/7777.wav|EN-US|EN| He is particularly happy with the size of the cowrie.
10k/wav/7783.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, he should know.
10k/wav/7790.wav|EN-US|EN| It means an enormous amount.
10k/wav/7799.wav|EN-US|EN| Drum is not one of them.
10k/wav/7814.wav|EN-US|EN| Ministers received the report with frosty reticins.
10k/wav/7815.wav|EN-US|EN| It would fit very well with us.
10k/wav/7826.wav|EN-US|EN| The Board has rejected our proposals.
10k/wav/7837.wav|EN-US|EN| We did not complete the process.
10k/wav/7852.wav|EN-US|EN| People are so negative about the whole business.
10k/wav/7856.wav|EN-US|EN| However, the grubs denied the claims.
10k/wav/7863.wav|EN-US|EN| He has been under great pressure.
10k/wav/7866.wav|EN-US|EN| We need to establish the facts.
10k/wav/787.wav|EN-US|EN| AIM is a top 6 finish.
10k/wav/7882.wav|EN-US|EN| Fuller, they have gone as far as they can
10k/wav/7899.wav|EN-US|EN| It is very important that we get the balance right.
10k/wav/79.wav|EN-US|EN| But the challenge is a mess.
10k/wav/792.wav|EN-US|EN| But no party would win over all control of Scotland.
10k/wav/795.wav|EN-US|EN| There is a good chance of seeing something.
10k/wav/7955.wav|EN-US|EN| Their bodies were never found
10k/wav/7963.wav|EN-US|EN| For next season, we have time to restructure.
10k/wav/7972.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything is a known place for Manchester.
10k/wav/798.wav|EN-US|EN| This isn't a gimmick.
10k/wav/7990.wav|EN-US|EN| Let's not take too much for granted.
10k/wav/7993.wav|EN-US|EN| Did you get the script?
10k/wav/8001.wav|EN-US|EN| Structural changes were also required.
10k/wav/8002.wav|EN-US|EN| Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
10k/wav/8004.wav|EN-US|EN| The play is based on a real life event.
10k/wav/8013.wav|EN-US|EN| Our eccentric countrymen are disservice.
10k/wav/8026.wav|EN-US|EN| They said that this stood by their statement.
10k/wav/8029.wav|EN-US|EN| It's hard to say it.
10k/wav/803.wav|EN-US|EN| It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
10k/wav/8046.wav|EN-US|EN| He has had success at every level.
10k/wav/8063.wav|EN-US|EN| I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
10k/wav/8065.wav|EN-US|EN| I am very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
10k/wav/8069.wav|EN-US|EN| We offered something different.
10k/wav/8079.wav|EN-US|EN| I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
10k/wav/8086.wav|EN-US|EN| However, there are also many areas of agreement
10k/wav/8094.wav|EN-US|EN| He goes very close tonight.
10k/wav/8113.wav|EN-US|EN| But we say yes and we are the people.
10k/wav/8114.wav|EN-US|EN| We want to know about the policy.
10k/wav/8115.wav|EN-US|EN| There are warps.
10k/wav/8118.wav|EN-US|EN| It all seemed so easy.
10k/wav/8123.wav|EN-US|EN| She was there for the start of the campaign.
10k/wav/8128.wav|EN-US|EN| That's because it is perfect
10k/wav/8137.wav|EN-US|EN| That sort of thing is long gone.
10k/wav/8147.wav|EN-US|EN| The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
10k/wav/8166.wav|EN-US|EN| This performance has given my confidence a boost.
10k/wav/8172.wav|EN-US|EN| We have always been and remain confident of securing the order.
10k/wav/8179.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully it will come from someone on our site.
10k/wav/819.wav|EN-US|EN| We got the guarantee.
10k/wav/8197.wav|EN-US|EN| It was no surprise.
10k/wav/8202.wav|EN-US|EN| I had no experience at all.
10k/wav/8206.wav|EN-US|EN| It's the cut of our time, Marini.
10k/wav/822.wav|EN-US|EN| The result is that Elite component.
10k/wav/8229.wav|EN-US|EN| Sir Jeremy from Glasgow said they had been delighted.
10k/wav/8232.wav|EN-US|EN| It attracted note complaints.
10k/wav/8256.wav|EN-US|EN| I have always believed in myself.
10k/wav/826.wav|EN-US|EN| I think he is the favorite, my question.
10k/wav/8260.wav|EN-US|EN| That's how the bite is now gone.
10k/wav/8295.wav|EN-US|EN| It's a member of your family.
10k/wav/8296.wav|EN-US|EN| There is precious little Madool Grant.
10k/wav/8313.wav|EN-US|EN| The music is therefore profanity suppressive.
10k/wav/8349.wav|EN-US|EN| I was really excited about the album.
10k/wav/8351.wav|EN-US|EN| We were fortunate to get our known goal.
10k/wav/8353.wav|EN-US|EN| I wonder what they listen to.
10k/wav/8387.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone is deeply shocked by this appealing accident.
10k/wav/8391.wav|EN-US|EN| I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
10k/wav/8412.wav|EN-US|EN| Spent three months all at sea.
10k/wav/8414.wav|EN-US|EN| She has been enabled to work since.
10k/wav/8418.wav|EN-US|EN| The hill-form is owned by the father of the non-man.
10k/wav/8421.wav|EN-US|EN| The man has already had too many chances.
10k/wav/8425.wav|EN-US|EN| Lack of pace is his big problem.
10k/wav/8440.wav|EN-US|EN| It has to reinvent itself.
10k/wav/8444.wav|EN-US|EN| He was released in March this year.
10k/wav/8448.wav|EN-US|EN| The industry will try to get round it.
10k/wav/8449.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm a lucky man.
10k/wav/8457.wav|EN-US|EN| When we played them last year, we repeat in part the weather.
10k/wav/846.wav|EN-US|EN| No one is predicting a sudden rebound.
10k/wav/8464.wav|EN-US|EN| Cordon Brahm was a pup.
10k/wav/8482.wav|EN-US|EN| It was so new, so exciting.
10k/wav/8484.wav|EN-US|EN| I was brought up in a mining background.
10k/wav/8501.wav|EN-US|EN| The service from the other players was super.
10k/wav/8504.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a united kingdom.
10k/wav/8514.wav|EN-US|EN| We have a problem.
10k/wav/8515.wav|EN-US|EN| The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
10k/wav/8521.wav|EN-US|EN| It happened on average once a week this year.
10k/wav/8522.wav|EN-US|EN| We just love to chat.
10k/wav/8531.wav|EN-US|EN| This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
10k/wav/8532.wav|EN-US|EN| Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
10k/wav/8540.wav|EN-US|EN| But it may not be all bad news.
10k/wav/8546.wav|EN-US|EN| It was a horrible thing to happen.
10k/wav/8565.wav|EN-US|EN| Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
10k/wav/8569.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not known to myself.
10k/wav/8571.wav|EN-US|EN| He only is a lovely man.
10k/wav/8595.wav|EN-US|EN| I wanted to make a vigorous defence.
10k/wav/8603.wav|EN-US|EN| It's something we want to make luck.
10k/wav/8609.wav|EN-US|EN| It's not one or the other. You have to have both.
10k/wav/8627.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't teach you about doing it myself.
10k/wav/863.wav|EN-US|EN| These matters can just be medical decisions.
10k/wav/8641.wav|EN-US|EN| People were hitting the floor.
10k/wav/8647.wav|EN-US|EN| However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
10k/wav/8655.wav|EN-US|EN| But that is entirely matter for them.
10k/wav/8658.wav|EN-US|EN| But we finished the show.
10k/wav/8664.wav|EN-US|EN| The other children were severely mentally impaired.
10k/wav/867.wav|EN-US|EN| I mean, they have just been a disaster.
10k/wav/8694.wav|EN-US|EN| I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact
10k/wav/870.wav|EN-US|EN| His mother affuses to believe that she is dead.
10k/wav/8708.wav|EN-US|EN| I now repeat, it would be for exposure and money
10k/wav/8726.wav|EN-US|EN| He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
10k/wav/8727.wav|EN-US|EN| In addition, margins have been maintained.
10k/wav/8734.wav|EN-US|EN| There are two dolphins from Scotland.
10k/wav/8739.wav|EN-US|EN| It was not frightening to watch.
10k/wav/8758.wav|EN-US|EN| Let there be light.
10k/wav/876.wav|EN-US|EN| I just want him to win a tournament.
10k/wav/877.wav|EN-US|EN| I love the tradition of vaudeville.
10k/wav/8771.wav|EN-US|EN| Three months or so later they are returning.
10k/wav/8772.wav|EN-US|EN| It was an ambush.
10k/wav/8778.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm delighted for everyone in that jury.
10k/wav/8791.wav|EN-US|EN| Everyone's too upset to comment.
10k/wav/8792.wav|EN-US|EN| Leibov was too busy to respond.
10k/wav/882.wav|EN-US|EN| He is a bully.
10k/wav/8820.wav|EN-US|EN| It should not lose out in any way.
10k/wav/8836.wav|EN-US|EN| They had no children.
10k/wav/884.wav|EN-US|EN| The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
10k/wav/8841.wav|EN-US|EN| There was no question of him not impressing.
10k/wav/8843.wav|EN-US|EN| Arthur not considered the job done.
10k/wav/8844.wav|EN-US|EN| Those senior officials were dismissed last week.
10k/wav/8884.wav|EN-US|EN| The plot is changing as time goes on.
10k/wav/8886.wav|EN-US|EN| Clearly, she says we would never resort to such devices.
10k/wav/8906.wav|EN-US|EN| I will have to think about it.
10k/wav/8908.wav|EN-US|EN| People were actually not on his side.
10k/wav/8915.wav|EN-US|EN| Everything people said about it was true.
10k/wav/8916.wav|EN-US|EN| Imanthan was Gary Robertson from Dundee
10k/wav/8924.wav|EN-US|EN| No further details of expansion plants were given.
10k/wav/8935.wav|EN-US|EN| These will take a little time to develop.
10k/wav/8941.wav|EN-US|EN| Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
10k/wav/8944.wav|EN-US|EN| I had troubles with the producers.
10k/wav/8951.wav|EN-US|EN| The study carried out by the consumer magazine north.
10k/wav/8953.wav|EN-US|EN| Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
10k/wav/8959.wav|EN-US|EN| Racism is life and kicking in Scotland.
10k/wav/8964.wav|EN-US|EN| As for all, class is permanent
10k/wav/8974.wav|EN-US|EN| Seven British members of the club are missing.
10k/wav/9018.wav|EN-US|EN| It is all about having physical evidence.
10k/wav/9034.wav|EN-US|EN| The fire was still coming down
10k/wav/9039.wav|EN-US|EN| The herring was continued until a later date.
10k/wav/9067.wav|EN-US|EN| Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
10k/wav/9072.wav|EN-US|EN| Are they muscular problems?
10k/wav/9080.wav|EN-US|EN| He must have sat down, believed it was over.
10k/wav/9089.wav|EN-US|EN| Some have other commitments.
10k/wav/91.wav|EN-US|EN| We are very strongly behind the bit.
10k/wav/9100.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a Christian award.
10k/wav/9102.wav|EN-US|EN| He's been in an awesome home for two years.
10k/wav/9104.wav|EN-US|EN| They were the best team but unlucky in the end.
10k/wav/9108.wav|EN-US|EN| Of course Zenden was fantastic.
10k/wav/9116.wav|EN-US|EN| In his absence, the council adopted the change.
10k/wav/9118.wav|EN-US|EN| Well, you can have a tree.
10k/wav/9119.wav|EN-US|EN| It was the train coming.
10k/wav/9152.wav|EN-US|EN| The hill region is in shock.
10k/wav/9156.wav|EN-US|EN| This has been a terrible experience.
10k/wav/9158.wav|EN-US|EN| He just carried on filming.
10k/wav/9164.wav|EN-US|EN| That remains the unanswered question.
10k/wav/9179.wav|EN-US|EN| He also insisted that no concession have been made to the French.
10k/wav/9180.wav|EN-US|EN| Two years later, she was dead.
10k/wav/9205.wav|EN-US|EN| I didn't really expect to be called up.
10k/wav/9207.wav|EN-US|EN| The group will report back in the summer.
10k/wav/9224.wav|EN-US|EN| As she explains
10k/wav/9265.wav|EN-US|EN| We are all suffering.
10k/wav/9304.wav|EN-US|EN| The idea is not me.
10k/wav/9306.wav|EN-US|EN| He's got to look after himself now.
10k/wav/9309.wav|EN-US|EN| He will have something to say.
10k/wav/9313.wav|EN-US|EN| Does this matter?
10k/wav/9322.wav|EN-US|EN| as well it might be.
10k/wav/9324.wav|EN-US|EN| This should realise the Chairman wants the Deputy he can trust.
10k/wav/933.wav|EN-US|EN| It is a victory to that extent.
10k/wav/9334.wav|EN-US|EN| It didn't come as any great surprise.
10k/wav/9352.wav|EN-US|EN| We have to find a way to put that right.
10k/wav/9372.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a sector in the rule deficit and urgent action is required.
10k/wav/9377.wav|EN-US|EN| My mind is the most important thing there.
10k/wav/9378.wav|EN-US|EN| It has been made to entertain.
10k/wav/9380.wav|EN-US|EN| Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
10k/wav/9403.wav|EN-US|EN| It seemed a logical expansion.
10k/wav/941.wav|EN-US|EN| This is a test of our character.
10k/wav/9424.wav|EN-US|EN| He's just a net for himself.
10k/wav/9458.wav|EN-US|EN| Further savings were diced from common procurement and its systems.
10k/wav/9467.wav|EN-US|EN| which may be the same thing.
10k/wav/947.wav|EN-US|EN| because I was a very physical person.
10k/wav/9479.wav|EN-US|EN| I have been to see him.
10k/wav/9484.wav|EN-US|EN| But it's just great to have one.
10k/wav/9497.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm desperate to play for Scotland.
10k/wav/9515.wav|EN-US|EN| They included certain insurance policies and a show of the house.
10k/wav/952.wav|EN-US|EN| It's always the same, isn't it?
10k/wav/9526.wav|EN-US|EN| We are going through difficult times.
10k/wav/9542.wav|EN-US|EN| Sadly, the camel never sees like a can.
10k/wav/9552.wav|EN-US|EN| We've had several problems over injuries.
10k/wav/9565.wav|EN-US|EN| Caught to win today, though.
10k/wav/9571.wav|EN-US|EN| I'm families accounted for growing show of the trade.
10k/wav/9576.wav|EN-US|EN| They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
10k/wav/9587.wav|EN-US|EN| This is the time to use it
10k/wav/96.wav|EN-US|EN| They should come clean.
10k/wav/9609.wav|EN-US|EN| His style is suited to Scottish football.
10k/wav/9613.wav|EN-US|EN| The net is closing.
10k/wav/9637.wav|EN-US|EN| He's the sort of mystery figure.
10k/wav/9640.wav|EN-US|EN| The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
10k/wav/9653.wav|EN-US|EN| They might be surprised by the response.
10k/wav/9661.wav|EN-US|EN| Who wouldn't date?
10k/wav/9670.wav|EN-US|EN| I am not interested in the job.
10k/wav/9688.wav|EN-US|EN| He leaves the wife, son and a daughter.
